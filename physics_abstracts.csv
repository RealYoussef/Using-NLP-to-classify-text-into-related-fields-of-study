Label,Number,Abstract
0,1,"  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field
fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,
American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees
with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil
evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5
billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests
that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from
Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts
that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).
"
0,2,"  Spatiotemporal pattern formation in a product-activated enzymic reaction at
high enzyme concentrations is investigated. Stochastic simulations show that
catalytic turnover cycles of individual enzymes can become coherent and that
complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can develop. The analysis
based on the mean-field approximation indicates that the observed patterns
result from the presence of Hopf and wave bifurcations in the considered
system.
"
0,3,"  We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete
dipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are
bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when
the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is
significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.
Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller
than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term
decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough
scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical
simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number
of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.
"
0,4,"  We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the
discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique
was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using
many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with
refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for
cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was
demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were
proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate
shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.
"
0,5,"  In this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the Discrete Dipole
Approximation (DDA) to simulate scattering from particles that are much larger
than the wavelength of the incident light, and describe an optimized publicly
available DDA computer program that processes the large number of dipoles
required for such simulations. Numerical simulations of light scattering by
spheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and
2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory.
Errors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally
increase with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times
increase steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a
cluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program
is the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of
computers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large
particles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current
limitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.
"
0,6,"  We present a review of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is a
general method to simulate light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles. We
put the method in historical context and discuss recent developments, taking
the viewpoint of a general framework based on the integral equations for the
electric field. We review both the theory of the DDA and its numerical aspects,
the latter being of critical importance for any practical application of the
method. Finally, the position of the DDA among other methods of light
scattering simulation is shown and possible future developments are discussed.
"
0,7,"  It is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation to
the requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using a
quantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It
is so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between
observer and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values of
quantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful
for systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum
coherence.
"
0,8,"  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical
plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.
"
0,9,"  A novel way of picturing the processing of quantum information is described,
allowing a direct visualization of teleportation of quantum states and
providing a simple and intuitive understanding of this fascinating phenomenon.
The discussion is aimed at providing physicists a method of explaining
teleportation to non-scientists. The basic ideas of quantum physics are first
explained in lay terms, after which these ideas are used with a graphical
description, out of which teleportation arises naturally.
"
0,10,"  I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is
very rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of
the founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that the
evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall
develop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall show
that if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available
resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle
of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to
survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is
indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent
life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I
shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over
antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.

"
0,12,"  The Dark Energy problem is forcing us to re-examine our models and our
understanding of relativity and space-time. Here a novel idea of Fundamental
Forces is introduced. This allows us to perceive the General Theory of
Relativity and Einstein's Equation from a new pesrpective. In addition to
providing us with an improved understanding of space and time, it will be shown
how it leads to a resolution of the Dark Energy problem.
"
0,13,"  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of
clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider
large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be
neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an
additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.
"
0,14,"  The results of the spectral, energetical and temporal characteristics of
radiation in the presence of the photonic flame effect are presented.
Artificial opal posed on Cu plate at the temperature of liquid nitrogen boiling
point (77 K) being irradiated by nanosecond ruby laser pulse produces long-
term luminiscence with a duration till ten seconds with a finely structured
spectrum in the the antistocks part of the spectrum. Analogous visible
luminescence manifesting time delay appeared in other samples of the artificial
opals posed on the same plate. In the case of the opal infiltrated with
different nonlinear liquids the threshold of the luminiscence is reduced and
the spatial disribution of the bright emmiting area on the opal surface is
being changed. In the case of the putting the frozen nonlinear liquids on the
Cu plate long-term blue bright luminiscence took place in the frozen species of
the liquids. Temporal characteristics of this luminiscence are nearly the same
as in opal matrixes.
"
0,15,"  Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the
probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by
experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively
by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical
law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental
data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the
kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The
proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy
chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict
a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor
error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is
expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are
used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the
predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.
"
0,16,"  Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS) has three recursive
sampling/optimization shells. An outer Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)
optimization shell optimizes parameters of strategic Plans containing multiple
Projects containing ordered Tasks. A middle shell samples probability
distributions of durations of Tasks. An inner shell samples probability
distributions of costs of Tasks. PATHTREE is used to develop options on
schedules.. Algorithms used for Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD) are applied to
develop a relative risk analysis among projects.
"
0,17,"  A physical law is represented by the probability distribution of a measured
variable. The probability density is described by measured data using an
estimator whose kernel is the instrument scattering function. The experimental
information and data redundancy are defined in terms of information entropy.
The model cost function, comprised of data redundancy and estimation error, is
minimized by the creation-annihilation process.
"
0,18,"  The microwave phonon stimulated emission (SE) has been experimentally and
numerically investigated in a nonautonomous microwave acoustic quantum
generator, called also microwave phonon laser or phaser (see previous works
arXiv:cond-mat/0303188 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0402640 ; arXiv:nlin.CG/0703050)
Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction on
the external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE were
observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the
pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of
coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in
computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching
density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is
closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange
attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the
higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.
"
0,19,"  Based on overall experimental observations, especially the pair processes, I
developed a model structure of the vacuum along with a basic-particle formation
scheme begun in 2000 (with collaborator P-I Johansson). The model consists in
that the vacuum is, briefly, filled of neutral but polarizable vacuuons,
consisting each of a p-vaculeon and n- vaculeon of charges $+e$ and $-e$ of
zero rest masses but with spin motions, assumed interacting each other with a
Coulomb force. The model has been introduced in full in a book (Nova Sci, 2005)
and referred to in a number of journal/E-print papers. I outline in this easier
accessible paper the detailed derivation of the model and a corresponding
quantitative determination of the vacuuon size.
"
0,20,"  The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the
trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion
electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the
trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic,
gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions
of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which
are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the
trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and
strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field
source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results
show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.
"
0,21,"  Statistical ensemble formalism of Kim, Mandel and Wolf (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 4,
433 (1987)) offers a realistic model for characterizing the effect of
stochastic non-image forming optical media on the state of polarization of
transmittedlight. With suitable choice of the Jones ensemble, various Mueller
transformations - some of which have been unknown so far - are deduced. It is
observed that the ensemble approach is formally identical to the positive
operator valued measures (POVM) on the quantum density matrix. This
observation, in combination with the recent suggestion by Ahnert and Payne
(Phys. Rev. A 71, 012330, (2005)) - in the context of generalized quantum
measurement on single photon polarization states - that linear optics elements
can be employed in setting up all possible POVMs, enables us to propose a way
of realizing different types of Mueller devices.
"
0,22,"  The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x
and y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability
density functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose
kernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)
the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based
upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information
and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.
With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the
experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference
between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of
data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the
true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the
redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number
of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual
information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the
variables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is
used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the
introduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly
related variables.
"
0,23,"  Classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding
(finite time) difference equation. The equation is, then, symmetrized so that
it remains invariant under the change d going to -d, where d is the smallest
span of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocally
related pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the
other is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to
0. This solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple of
half-integers.
"
0,24,"  An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of the
structural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponent
hard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield a
thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the
known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions
for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the
corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of
this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and
square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation
theory of fluids are briefly addressed.
"
0,25,"  Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the
complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed
for its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the
entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of
experimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to
integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy
is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about
these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of
the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and
information cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of
the phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments
needed for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost
function. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is
demonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.
"
0,26,"  Using the recently reported mode locking effect we demonstrate a highly
robust control of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of (In,Ga)As quantum
dots during the single spin coherence time. The spin precession in a transverse
magnetic field can be fully controlled up to 25 K by the parameters of the
exciting pulsed laser protocol such as the pulse train sequence, leading to
adjustable quantum beat bursts in Faraday rotation. Flipping of the electron
spin precession phase was demonstrated by inverting the polarization within a
pulse doublet sequence.
"
0,27,"  We calculate the equation of state of dense hydrogen within the chemical
picture. Fluid variational theory is generalized for a multi-component system
of molecules, atoms, electrons, and protons. Chemical equilibrium is supposed
for the reactions dissociation and ionization. We identify the region of
thermodynamic instability which is related to the plasma phase transition. The
reflectivity is calculated along the Hugoniot curve and compared with
experimental results. The equation-of-state data is used to calculate the
pressure and temperature profiles for the interior of Jupiter.
"
0,28,"  We investigate the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to design a set of
photonic crystals (PCs) in one and two dimensions. Our flexible design
methodology allows us to optimize PC structures which are optimized for
specific objectives. In this paper, we report the results of several such
GA-based PC optimizations. We show that the GA performs well even in very
complex design spaces, and therefore has great potential for use as a robust
design tool in present and future applications.
"
0,29,"  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather
unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots
are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein
function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein
Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.
"
0,30,"  We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation
in the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a series
of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation
of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation
time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum.
The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional
Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to
both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several
experimental tests in such optical systems.
"
0,31,"  There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical
possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.
The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1}
is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and
permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular
transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking
in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.
This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical
problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the
permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked
objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the
electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that
the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially
self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily
equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the
coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the
scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the
construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and
active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove
cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove
that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.
"
0,32,"  We study material lines and passive vectors in a model of turbulent flow at
infinite-Reynolds number, the Kraichnan-Kazantsev ensemble of velocities that
are white-noise in time and rough (Hoelder continuous) in space. It is argued
that the phenomenon of ``spontaneous stochasticity'' generalizes to material
lines and that conservation of circulations generalizes to a ``martingale
property'' of the stochastic process of lines.
"
0,33,"  We present a new version of TaylUR, a Fortran 95 module to automatically
compute the numerical values of a complex-valued function's derivatives with
respect to several variables up to an arbitrary order in each variable, but
excluding mixed derivatives. The new version fixes a potentially serious bug in
the code for exponential-related functions that could corrupt the imaginary
parts of derivatives, as well as being compatible with a wider range of
compilers.
"
0,34,"  We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam
quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman
transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman
outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on
the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom
laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments
with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom
lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the
condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg
limit.
"
0,35,"  Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmic
rays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the
extensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, the
light signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only
attenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background component
due to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correction
requires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol
phase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given
direction. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase
function is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)
light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of
the fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image
of the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the
design, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the
APF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
"
0,36,"  We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in
polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single
microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly
aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization
microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the
polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional
force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity
curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT
bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis
implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.
"
0,37,"  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks
has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.
Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these
networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more
detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of
network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network
structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world
effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering
coefficient in a network.
"
0,38,"  We report on measurements of the transverse fluctuations of a string in a
turbulent air jet flow. Harmonic modes are excited by the fluctuating drag
force, at different wave-numbers. This simple mechanical probe makes it
possible to measure excitations of the flow at specific scales, averaged over
space and time: it is a scale-resolved, global measurement. We also measure the
dissipation associated to the string motion, and we consider the ratio of the
fluctuations over dissipation (FDR). In an exploratory approach, we investigate
the concept of {\it effective temperature} defined through the FDR. We compare
our observations with other definitions of temperature in turbulence. From the
theory of Kolmogorov (1941), we derive the exponent -11/3 expected for the
spectrum of the fluctuations. This simple model and our experimental results
are in good agreement, over the range of wave-numbers, and Reynolds number
accessible ($74000 \leq Re \leq 170000$).
"
0,39,"  In line with the local philicity concept proposed by Chattaraj et al.
(Chattaraj, P. K.; Maiti, B.; Sarkar, U. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2003, 107, 4973) and
a dual descriptor derived by Toro-Labbe and coworkers (Morell, C.; Grand, A.;
Toro-Labbe, A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2005, 109, 205), we propose a multiphilic
descriptor. It is defined as the difference between nucleophilic (Wk+) and
electrophilic (Wk-) condensed philicity functions. This descriptor is capable
of simultaneously explaining the nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of the
given atomic sites in the molecule. Variation of these quantities along the
path of a soft reaction is also analyzed. Predictive ability of this descriptor
has been successfully tested on the selected systems and reactions.
Corresponding force profiles are also analyzed in some representative cases.
Also, to study the intra- and intermolecular reactivities another related
descriptor namely, the nucleophilicity excess (DelW-+) for a nucleophile, over
the electrophilicity in it has been defined and tested on all-metal aromatic
compounds.
"
0,40,"  In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted
to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain
unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a
discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations,
i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).
The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse
kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this
problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important
requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial
distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic
approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations
\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates
of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial
compressibility method are discussed.
"
0,41,"  We study numerically the cascading failure problem by using artificially
created scale-free networks and the real network structure of the power grid.
The capacity for a vertex is assigned as a monotonically increasing function of
the load (or the betweenness centrality). Through the use of a simple
functional form with two free parameters, revealed is that it is indeed
possible to make networks more robust while spending less cost. We suggest that
our method to prevent cascade by protecting less vertices is particularly
important for the design of more robust real-world networks to cascading
failures.
"
0,42,"  Ponderable objects moving in free space according to Newton's First Law
constitute both rulers and clocks when one such object is viewed from the rest
frame of another. Together with the Reciprocity Principle this is used to
demonstrate, in both Galilean and special relativity, the invariance of the
measured length of a ruler in motion. The different times: `proper', `improper'
and `apparent' appearing in different formulations of the relativistic time
dilatation relation are discussed and exemplified by experimental applications.
A non-intuitive `length expansion' effect predicted by the Reciprocity
Principle as a necessary consequence of time dilatation is pointed out

"
0,44,"  The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: a
pure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propyne,
respectively. The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane
and 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure
methane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to
a ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have
been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,
with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration
profiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling
with a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and
dioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,
allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,
1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a
PtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from
700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,
some improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our
laboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main
reaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6
aromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.
"
0,45,"  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain
will help to understand its function and may provide insights into many
properties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to
their dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex
networks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and
functional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks
recently described allow their characterization as small-world, random
(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that
have been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,
hodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network
analysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and
macaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark
rewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis
strategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and
connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain
networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free
networks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck
connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain
systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'
connectivity.
"
0,46,"  We present an analytic example of two dimensional quantum mechanical system,
where the exponential suppression of the probability of over-barrier reflection
changes non-monotonically with energy. The suppression is minimal at certain
""optimal"" energies where reflection occurs with exponentially larger
probability than at other energies.
"
0,47,"  Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support either
leaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leaky
surface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagation
direction of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connection
between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the
corresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability)
so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the
impinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can be
explained by the excitation of these leaky modes.
"
0,48,"  We experimentally demonstrate controlled polarization-selective phenomena in
a whispering gallery mode resonator. We observed efficient ($\approx 75 %$)
polarization conversion of light in a silica microsphere coupled to a tapered
optical fiber with proper optimization of the polarization of the propagating
light. A simple model treating the microsphere as a ring resonator provides a
good fit to the observed behavior.
"
0,49,"  We report a new effect of surfactants in pinning a drop contact line,
specifically that lysozyme promotes while lauryl sulfate inhibits pinning. We
explain the pinning disparity assuming difference in wetting: the protein-laden
drop wets a ""clean"" surface and the surfactant-laden drop wets an
auto-precursored surface.
"
0,50,"  How to effectively solve the eigen solutions of the nonlinear spinor field
equation coupling with some other interaction fields is important to understand
the behavior of the elementary particles. In this paper, we derive a simplified
form of the eigen equation of the nonlinear spinor, and then propose a scheme
to solve their numerical solutions. This simplified equation has elegant and
neat structure, which is more convenient for both theoretical analysis and
numerical computation.
"
0,51,"  We show that two distinct quantum states of the electromagnetic field can be
associated to a classical vector X wave or a propagation-invariant solution of
Maxwell equations. The difference between the two states is of pure quantum
mechanical origin since they are internally entangled and disentangled,
respectively and can be generated by different linear or nonlinear processes.
Detection and generation of Schr\""odinger-cat states comprising two entangled
X-waves and their possible applications are discussed.
"
0,52,"  We measured the correlation of the times between successive flaps of a flag
for a variety of wind speeds and found no evidence of low dimensional chaotic
behavior in the return maps of these times. We instead observed what is best
modeled as random times determined by an exponential distribution. This study
was done as an undergraduate experiment and illustrates the differences between
low dimensional chaotic and possibly higher dimensional chaotic systems.
"
0,53,"  Because observations of galaxies and clusters have been found inconsistent
with General Relativity (GR), the focus of effort in developing a Scalar
Potential Model (SPM) has been on the examination of galaxies and clusters. The
SPM has been found to be consistent with cluster cellular structure, the flow
of IGM from spiral galaxies to elliptical galaxies, intergalactic redshift
without an expanding universe, discrete redshift, rotation curve (RC) data
without dark matter, asymmetric RCs, galaxy central mass, galaxy central
velocity dispersion, and the Pioneer Anomaly. In addition, the SPM suggests a
model of past expansion, past contraction, and current expansion of the
universe. GR corresponds to the SPM in the limit in which the effect of the
Sources and Sinks approximate a flat scalar potential field such as between
clusters and on the solar system scale, which is small relative to the distance
to a Source.
"
0,54,"  In this paper we investigate some entanglement properties for the Hydrogen
molecule considered as a two interacting spin 1/2 (qubit) model. The
entanglement related to the $H_{2}$ molecule is evaluated both using the von
Neumann entropy and the Concurrence and it is compared with the corresponding
quantities for the two interacting spin system. Many aspects of these functions
are examinated employing in part analytical and, essentially, numerical
techniques. We have compared analogous results obtained by Huang and Kais a few
years ago. In this respect, some possible controversial situations are
presented and discussed.
"
0,55,"  Useful information about scientific collaboration structures and patterns can
be inferred from computer databases of published papers. The genetic
programming bibliography is the most complete reference of papers on GP\@. In
addition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditor
relationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treat
these relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals the
community structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysis
discovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigation
reveals many similarities between GP and coauthorship networks in other
scientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller central
network component and a high clustering.
"
0,56,"  During a crossover via a switching mechanism from one 2-body potential to
another as might be applied in modeling (chemical) reactions in the vicinity of
bond formation, energy violations would occur due to finite step size which
determines the trajectory of the particles relative to the potential
interactions of the unbonded state by numerical (e.g. Verlet) integration. This
problem is overcome by an algorithm which preserves the coordinates of the
system for each move, but corrects for energy discrepancies by ensuring both
energy and momentum conservation in the dynamics. The algorithm is tested for a
hysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of the
algorithm. The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MD
simulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows within
experimental error should be observed. The temperature and pressure of the box
should also be invariant within the range of fluctuation of these quantities.
It is demonstrated that the algorithm satisfies these criteria.
"
0,57,"  An overview is presented of laser spectroscopy experiments with cold,
trapped, highly-charged ions, which will be performed at the HITRAP facility at
GSI in Darmstadt (Germany). These high-resolution measurements of ground state
hyperfine splittings will be three orders of magnitude more precise than
previous measurements. Moreover, from a comparison of measurements of the
hyperfine splittings in hydrogen- and lithium-like ions of the same isotope,
QED effects at high electromagnetic fields can be determined within a few
percent. Several candidate ions suited for these laser spectroscopy studies are
presented.
"
0,58,"  A new method, FM-FTS, combining Frequency Modulation heterodyne laser
spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Spectroscopy is presented. It provides
simultaneous sensitive measurement of absorption and dispersion profiles with
broadband spectral coverage capabilities. Experimental demonstration is made on
the overtone spectrum of C2H2 in the 1.5 $\mu$m region.
"
0,59,"  In the last years the traditional scenario of Big Bang has been deeply
modified by the study of the quantum features of the Universe evolution,
proposing again the problem of using local physical laws on cosmic scale, with
particular regard to the cosmological constant role. The group extention method
shows that the De Sitter group univocally generalizes the Poincare group,
formally justifies the cosmological constant use and suggests a new
interpretation for Hartle-Hawking boundary conditions in Quantum Cosmology.
"
0,60,"  We discuss an alternative non-perturbative proof of Bertrand's theorem that
leads in a concise way directly to the two allowed fields: the newtonian and
the isotropic harmonic oscillator central fields.
"
0,61,"  We analyze 27 house price indexes of Las Vegas from Jun. 1983 to Mar. 2005,
corresponding to 27 different zip codes. These analyses confirm the existence
of a real-estate bubble, defined as a price acceleration faster than
exponential, which is found however to be confined to a rather limited time
interval in the recent past from approximately 2003 to mid-2004 and has
progressively transformed into a more normal growth rate comparable to
pre-bubble levels in 2005. There has been no bubble till 2002 except for a
medium-sized surge in 1990. In addition, we have identified a strong yearly
periodicity which provides a good potential for fine-tuned prediction from
month to month. A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed could
confirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returned
to ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolution
of the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep.
2006. The present analysis demonstrates the existence of very significant
variations at the local scale, in the sense that the bubble in Las Vegas seems
to have preceded the more global USA bubble and has ended approximately two
years earlier (mid 2004 for Las Vegas compared with mid-2006 for the whole of
the USA).
"
0,62,"  We give a microscopic derivation of the Clausius-Mossotti relations for a
homogeneous and isotropic magneto-dielectric medium consisting of radiatively
broadened atomic oscillators. To this end the diagram series of electromagnetic
propagators is calculated exactly for an infinite bi-cubic lattice of
dielectric and magnetic dipoles for a lattice constant small compared to the
resonance wavelength $\lambda$. Modifications of transition frequencies and
linewidth of the elementary oscillators are taken into account in a
selfconsistent way by a proper incorporation of the singular self-interaction
terms. We show that in radiatively broadened media sufficiently close to the
free-space resonance the real part of the index of refraction approaches the
value -2 in the limit of $\rho \lambda^3 \gg 1$, where $\rho$ is the number
density of scatterers. Since at the same time the imaginary part vanishes as
$1/\rho$ local field effects can have important consequences for realizing
low-loss negative index materials.
"
0,63,"  Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networks
have strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into
account a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is
conditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the
structural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen
in a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise
affected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility
of emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to
different inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas
(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending
on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is
considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local
and global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly
adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis
shows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply
physical sense- the term gas here used.
"
0,64,"  We investigate the formation of collisionless shocks along the spatial
profile of a gaussian laser beam propagating in nonlocal nonlinear media. For
defocusing nonlinearity the shock survives the smoothing effect of the nonlocal
response, though its dynamics is qualitatively affected by the latter, whereas
for focusing nonlinearity it dominates over filamentation. The patterns
observed in a thermal defocusing medium are interpreted in the framework of our
theory.
"
0,65,"  Efficient control of a laser welding process requires the reliable prediction
of process behavior. A statistical method of field modeling, based on
normalized RBFNN, can be successfully used to predict the spatiotemporal
dynamics of surface optical activity in the laser welding process. In this
article we demonstrate how to optimize RBFNN to maximize prediction quality.
Special attention is paid to the structure of sample vectors, which represent
the bridge between the field distributions in the past and future.
"
0,66,"  We show that recent stock market fluctuations are characterized by the
cumulative distributions whose tails on short, minute time scales exhibit power
scaling with the scaling index alpha > 3 and this index tends to increase
quickly with decreasing sampling frequency. Our study is based on
high-frequency recordings of the S&P500, DAX and WIG20 indices over the
interval May 2004 - May 2006. Our findings suggest that dynamics of the
contemporary market may differ from the one observed in the past. This effect
indicates a constantly increasing efficiency of world markets.
"
0,67,"  We report on a new type of experiment that enables us to monitor spatially
and temporally heterogeneous dynamic properties in complex fluids. Our approach
is based on the analysis of near-field speckles produced by light diffusely
reflected from the superficial volume of a strongly scattering medium. By
periodic modulation of an incident speckle beam we obtain pixel-wise ensemble
averages of the structure function coefficient, a measure of the dynamic
activity. To illustrate the application of our approach we follow the different
stages in the drying process of a colloidal thin film. We show that we can
access ensemble averaged dynamic properties on length scales as small as ten
micrometers over the full field of view.
"
0,68,"  The purpose of this paper is to assess the statistical characterization of
weighted networks in terms of the generalization of the relevant parameters,
namely average path length, degree distribution and clustering coefficient.
Although the degree distribution and the average path length admit
straightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient several
different definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined the
different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between
them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the
weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of
the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm
of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study
revealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative
perturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weighted
graphs.
"
0,69,"  Simulations of physicists for the competition between adult languages since
2003 are reviewed. How many languages are spoken by how many people? How many
languages are contained in various language families? How do language
similarities decay with geographical distance, and what effects do natural
boundaries have? New simulations of bilinguality are given in an appendix.
"
0,70,"  Photon splitting due to vacuum polarization in a laser field is considered.
Using an operator technique, we derive the amplitudes for arbitrary strength,
spectral content and polarization of the laser field. The case of a
monochromatic circularly polarized laser field is studied in detail and the
amplitudes are obtained as three-fold integrals. The asymptotic behavior of the
amplitudes for various limits of interest are investigated also in the case of
a linearly polarized laser field. Using the obtained results, the possibility
of experimental observation of the process is discussed.
"
0,71,"  The thermal decomposition of norbornane (dissolved in benzene) has been
studied in a jet stirred reactor at temperatures between 873 and 973 K, at
residence times ranging from 1 to 4 s and at atmospheric pressure, leading to
conversions from 0.04 to 22.6%. 25 reaction products were identified and
quantified by gas chromatography, amongst which the main ones are hydrogen,
ethylene and 1,3-cyclopentadiene. A mechanism investigation of the thermal
decomposition of the norbornane - benzene binary mixture has been performed.
Reactions involved in the mechanism have been reviewed: unimolecular
initiations 1 by C-C bond scission of norbornane, fate of the generated
diradicals, reactions of transfer and propagation of norbornyl radicals,
reactions of benzene and cross-coupling reactions.
"
0,72,"  This work reports a theoretical study of the gas phase unimolecular
decomposition of cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane by means of quantum
chemical calculations. A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for each
cycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formed
have been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data
(\delta H^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) for all the involved species have been obtained by
means of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also been
included. Activation barriers of each reaction have been analyzed to assess the
1 energetically most favorable pathways for the decomposition of biradicals.
Rate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transition
state theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. Global rate
constant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products have
been calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowed
to validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that the
rotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are of
importance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals. Ring strain
energies (RSE) in transition states for ring opening have been estimated and
show that the main part of RSE contained in the cyclic reactants is removed
upon the activation process.
"
0,73,"  A review of theoretical and experimental studies of thermal effects in
solid-state lasers is presented, with a special focus on diode-pumped
ytterbium-doped materials. A large part of this review provides however general
information applicable to any kind of solid-state laser. Our aim here is not to
make a list of the techniques that have been used to minimize thermal effects,
but instead to give an overview of the theoretical aspects underneath, and give
a state-of-the-art of the tools at the disposal of the laser scientist to
measure thermal effects. After a presentation of some general properties of
Yb-doped materials, we address the issue of evaluating the temperature map in
Yb-doped laser crystals, both theoretically and experimentally. This is the
first step before studying the complex problem of thermal lensing (part III).
We will focus on some newly discussed aspects, like the definition of the
thermo-optic coefficient: we will highlight some misleading interpretations of
thermal lensing experiments due to the use of the dn/dT parameter in a context
where it is not relevant. Part IV will be devoted to a state-of-the-art of
experimental techniques used to measure thermal lensing. Eventually, in part V,
we will give some concrete examples in Yb-doped materials, where their
peculiarities will be pointed out.
"
0,74,"  We present a numerical study and analytical model of the optical near-field
diffracted in the vicinity of subwavelength grooves milled in silver surfaces.
The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude
dependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It is
shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent
to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic
expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well
the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient
surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this
model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient
""near-zone"" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,
it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes
the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient
near-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and
optimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part
will be controlled by surface waves.
"
0,75,"  We calculate angle-resolved above-threshold ionization spectra for diatomic
molecules in linearly polarized laser fields, employing the strong-field
approximation. The interference structure resulting from the individual
contributions of the different scattering scenarios is discussed in detail,
with respect to the dependence on the internuclear distance and molecular
orientation. We show that, in general, the contributions from the processes in
which the electron is freed at one center and rescatters off the other obscure
the interference maxima and minima obtained from single-center processes.
However, around the boundary of the energy regions for which rescattering has a
classical counterpart, such processes play a negligible role and very clear
interference patterns are observed. In such energy regions, one is able to
infer the internuclear distance from the energy difference between adjacent
interference minima.
"
0,76,"  When light is passing through a rotating medium the optical polarisation is
rotated. Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to the
transmitted image (Padgett et al. 2006). We examine these two phenomena by
extending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. We
find that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating
medium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular
momentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum
account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of
the transmitted image.
"
0,77,"  We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochastic
process with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis
(MF-DFA) method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In this
view we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges
(1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those
for shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to
long-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally we
determine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tail
has more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.
"
0,78,"  The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in
complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,
families, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent
changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the
associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.
Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is
limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and
self-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm
based on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate
the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to
uncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on
networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between
mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are
capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to
change the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small
groups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that
their composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the
time commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating
the community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental
differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.
"
0,79,"  Extensions of statistical mechanics are routinely being used to infer free
energies from the work performed over single-molecule nonequilibrium
trajectories. A key element of this approach is the ubiquitous expression
dW/dt=\partial H(x,t)/ \partial t which connects the microscopic work W
performed by a time-dependent force on the coordinate x with the corresponding
Hamiltonian H(x,t) at time t. Here we show that this connection, as pivotal as
it is, cannot be used to estimate free energy changes. We discuss the
implications of this result for single-molecule experiments and atomistic
molecular simulations and point out possible avenues to overcome these
limitations.
"
0,80,"  To investigate the universality of the structure of interactions in different
markets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuations
in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emerging
market exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to
developed markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to
be due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.
By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to
the same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector
identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network
of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,
the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by
random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.
We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions
between stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics
with a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal
structure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a
signature of market development.
"
0,81,"  Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are
presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a
distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the
electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass,
approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise,
however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains
decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from
the x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems,
independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.
"
0,82,"  Mechanisms of whispering-gallery (WG) modes coupling in microdisk photonic
molecules (PMs) with slight and significant size mismatch are numerically
investigated. The results reveal two different scenarios of modes interaction
depending on the degree of this mismatch and offer new insight into how PM
parameters can be tuned to control and modify WG-modes wavelengths and
Q-factors. From a practical point of view, these findings offer a way to
fabricate PM microlaser structures that exhibit low thresholds and directional
emission, and at the same time are more tolerant to fabrication errors than
previously explored coupled-cavity structures composed of identical
microresonators.
"
0,83,"  A new single-particle shell model is derived by solving the Schr\""odinger
equation for a semi-spheroidal potential well. Only the negative parity states
of the $Z(z)$ component of the wave function are allowed, so that new magic
numbers are obtained for oblate semi-spheroids, semi-sphere and prolate
semi-spheroids. The semi-spherical magic numbers are identical with those
obtained at the oblate spheroidal superdeformed shape: 2, 6, 14, 26, 44, 68,
100, 140, ... The superdeformed prolate magic numbers of the semi-spheroidal
shape are identical with those obtained at the spherical shape of the
spheroidal harmonic oscillator: 2, 8, 20, 40, 70, 112, 168 ...
"
0,84,"  Influence of hole shape on extraordinary optical transmission was
investigated using hole arrays consisting of rectangular holes with different
aspect ratio. It was found that the transmission could be tuned continuously by
rotating the hole array. Further more, a phase was generated in this process,
and linear polarization states could be changed to elliptical polarization
states. This phase was correlated with the aspect ratio of the holes. An
intuitional model was presented to explain these results.
"
0,85,"  The intercombination line of Strontium at 689nm is successfully used in laser
cooling to reach the photon recoil limit with Doppler cooling in a
magneto-optical traps (MOT). In this paper we present a systematic study of the
loading efficiency of such a MOT. Comparing the experimental results to a
simple model allows us to discuss the actual limitation of our apparatus. We
also study in detail the final MOT regime emphasizing the role of gravity on
the position, size and temperature along the vertical and horizontal
directions. At large laser detuning, one finds an unusual situation where
cooling and trapping occur in the presence of a high bias magnetic field.
"
0,86,"  We demonstrate that radiative transitions with \Delta l = - 1 are strongly
dominating for all values of n and l, except small region where l << n.
"
0,87,"  We are proposing to test experimentally the new idea of Enhanced Optical
Cooling (EOC) in an electron storage ring. This experiment will confirm new
fundamental processes in beam physics and will demonstrate new unique
possibilities with this cooling technique. It will open important applications
of EOC in nuclear physics, elementary particle physics and in Light Sources
(LS) based on high brightness electron and ion beams.
"
0,88,"  A new approach to non-extensive thermodynamical systems with non-additive
energy and entropy is proposed. The main idea of the paper is based on the
statistical matching of the thermodynamical systems with the additive
multi-step Markov chains. This general approach is applied to the Ising spin
chain with long-range interaction between its elements. The asymptotical
expressions for the energy and entropy of the system are derived for the
limiting case of weak interaction. These thermodynamical quantities are found
to be non-proportional to the length of the system (number of its particle).
"
0,89,"  For the 100 largest European universities we studied the statistical
properties of bibliometric indicators related to research performance, field
citation density and journal impact. We find a size-dependent cumulative
advantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.
In previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research
groups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property
of the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a
larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than
top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance
universities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with
size. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a
university, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the
average research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance
universities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of
activities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive
power. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities
the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations
per publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation
density found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of
the science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with
significantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance
universities. We find a significant decrease of the fraction of self-citations
with increasing research performance, average field citation density, and
average journal impact.
"
0,90,"  For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis to
investigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic
Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function
and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the
mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the
atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We
also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,
using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime
could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,
using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing
mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most
interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis
(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of
self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating
values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of
increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are
identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.
In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear
methods is further required.
"
0,91,"  We present a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the effect of
nuclear spin on the performance of optical lattice clocks. With a state-mixing
theory including spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions, we describe the origin
of the $^1S_0$-$^3P_0$ clock transition and the differential g-factor between
the two clock states for alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, using $^{87}$Sr as an
example. Clock frequency shifts due to magnetic and optical fields are
discussed with an emphasis on those relating to nuclear structure. An
experimental determination of the differential g-factor in $^{87}$Sr is
performed and is in good agreement with theory. The magnitude of the tensor
light shift on the clock states is also explored experimentally. State specific
measurements with controlled nuclear spin polarization are discussed as a
method to reduce the nuclear spin-related systematic effects to below
10$^{-17}$ in lattice clocks.
"
0,92,"  Cloaking devices are prescriptions of electrostatic, optical or
electromagnetic parameter fields (conductivity $\sigma(x)$, index of refraction
$n(x)$, or electric permittivity $\epsilon(x)$ and magnetic permeability
$\mu(x)$) which are piecewise smooth on $\mathbb R^3$ and singular on a
hypersurface $\Sigma$, and such that objects in the region enclosed by $\Sigma$
are not detectable to external observation by waves. Here, we give related
constructions of invisible tunnels, which allow electromagnetic waves to pass
between possibly distant points, but with only the ends of the tunnels visible
to electromagnetic imaging. Effectively, these change the topology of space
with respect to solutions of Maxwell's equations, corresponding to attaching a
handlebody to $\mathbb R^3$. The resulting devices thus function as
electromagnetic wormholes.
"
0,93,"  The historical significance of the problem of relativistic rigid rotation is
reviewed in light of recently published correspondence between Einstein and the
mathematician Vladimir Varicak from the years 1909 to 1913.
"
0,94,"  Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing, contained in a
scratch notebook and dated to the spring of 1912, are reexamined. A hitherto
unknown letter by Einstein suggests that he entertained the idea of explaining
the phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 much
more seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant
calculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely
date from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical
interpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova
Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context
and motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first
meeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We also
comment on the significance of Einstein's consideration of gravitational
lensing in the fall of 1915 for the reconstruction of Einstein's final steps in
his path towards general relativity.
"
0,95,"  The assumption of the capture by the Solar System of the electrically charged
Planckian DM objects (daemons) from the galactic disk is confirmed not only by
the St.Petersburg (SPb) experiments detecting particles with V<30 km/s. Here
the daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent
result of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals
observed in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the
Sun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it
moves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the
iodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles
falling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric
orbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb
originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg
into near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the
Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories
traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases
the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.
Corroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields
~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.
"
0,96,"  We describe a practical procedure for extracting the spatial structure and
the growth rates of slow eigenmodes of a spatially extended system, using a
unique experimental capability both to impose and to perturb desired initial
states. The procedure is used to construct experimentally the spectrum of
linear modes near the secondary instability boundary in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard
convection. This technique suggests an approach to experimental
characterization of more complex dynamical states such as periodic orbits or
spatiotemporal chaos.
"
0,97,"  We have studied the effect of annealing temperature on the statistical
properties of $WO_3$ surface using atomic force microscopy techniques (AFM). We
have applied both level crossing and structure function methods. Level crossing
analysis indicates an optimum annealing temperature of around 400$^oC$ at which
the effective area of the $WO_3$ thin film is maximum, whereas composition of
the surface remains stoichiometric. The complexity of the height fluctuation of
surfaces was characterized by roughness, roughness exponent and lateral size of
surface features. We have found that there is a phase transition at around
400$^oC$ from one set to two sets of roughness parameters. This happens due to
microstructural changes from amorphous to crystalline structure in the samples
that has been already found experimentally.
"
0,98,"  The effect of bias voltages on the statistical properties of rough surfaces
has been studied using atomic force microscopy technique and its stochastic
analysis. We have characterized the complexity of the height fluctuation of a
rough surface by the stochastic parameters such as roughness exponent, level
crossing, and drift and diffusion coefficients as a function of the applied
bias voltage. It is shown that these statistical as well as microstructural
parameters can also explain the macroscopic property of a surface. Furthermore,
the tip convolution effect on the stochastic parameters has been examined.
"
0,99,"  The effect of etching time scale of glass surface on its statistical
properties has been studied using atomic force microscopy technique. We have
characterized the complexity of the height fluctuation of a etched surface by
the stochastic parameters such as intermittency exponents, roughness, roughness
exponents, drift and diffusion coefficients and find their variations in terms
of the etching time.
"
0,100,"  The cosmological redshift phenomenon can be described by the dark matter
field fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the
observations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the
speed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If
the emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves
towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend
on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of
c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed
in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us
is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be
observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees
with current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of
the dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large
redshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate
that it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter
field fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the
same geometry (size and shape) in all inertial reference frames and do not have
length contraction effect.
"
0,101,"  Role of axiom of choice in quantum measurement is highlighted by suggesting
that the conscious observer chooses the outcome from a mixed state. Further, in
a periodically repeating universe, these outcomes must be pre-recorded within
the non-physical conscious observers, which precludes free will. Free will
however exists in a universe with open time, It is suggested that psychology's
binding problem is connected with Cantor's original definition of set.
Influence of consciousness on material outcome through quantum processes is
discussed and interesting constraints derived. For example, it is predicted
that quantum mechanical brain states should get frozen if monitored at
sufficiently small space-time intervals - a neuro-biological version of the so
called quantum zeno effect, which has been verified in domain of micro-physics.
Existence of a very small micro-mini-black-hole in brain is predicted as a
space-time structural interface between consciousness and brain, whose
vaporization explains mass-loss reported in weighing experiments, conducting
during the moments of death.
"
0,102,"  We analyse the dependence of stock return cross-correlations on the sampling
frequency of the data known as the Epps effect: For high resolution data the
cross-correlations are significantly smaller than their asymptotic value as
observed on daily data. The former description implies that changing trading
frequency should alter the characteristic time of the phenomenon. This is not
true for the empirical data: The Epps curves do not scale with market activity.
The latter result indicates that the time scale of the phenomenon is connected
to the reaction time of market participants (this we denote as human time
scale), independent of market activity. In this paper we give a new description
of the Epps effect through the decomposition of cross-correlations. After
testing our method on a model of generated random walk price changes we justify
our analytical results by fitting the Epps curves of real world data.
"
0,103,"  Human beings like to believe they are in control of their destiny. This
ubiquitous trait seems to increase motivation and persistence, and is probably
evolutionarily adaptive. But how good really is our ability to control? How
successful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding of
when and under what circumstances we may over-estimate or even lose our ability
to control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result of
aggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrate
analytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in
two classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents who
optimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse than
non-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative)
strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies. This provides a
precise definition of the ""illusion of control"" in set-ups a priori defined to
emphasize the importance of optimization.
"
0,104,"  Analysis of electromagnetic planewave propagation in a medium which is a
spatiotemporally homogeneous, temporally nonlocal, isotropic, chiral medium in
a co-moving frame of reference shows that the medium is both spatially and
temporally nonlocal with respect to all non-co-moving inertial frames of
reference. Using the Lorentz transformations of electric and magnetic fields,
we show that plane waves which have positive phase velocity in the co-moving
frame of reference can have negative phase velocity in certain non-co-moving
frames of reference. Similarly, plane waves which have negative phase velocity
in the co-moving frame can have positive phase velocity in certain
non-co-moving frames.

"
0,106,"  Elastic light scattering by mature red blood cells (RBCs) was theoretically
and experimentally analyzed with the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and
the scanning flow cytometry (SFC), respectively. SFC permits measurement of
angular dependence of light-scattering intensity (indicatrix) of single
particles. A mature RBC is modeled as a biconcave disk in DDA simulations of
light scattering. We have studied the effect of RBC orientation related to the
direction of the incident light upon the indicatrix. Numerical calculations of
indicatrices for several aspect ratios and volumes of RBC have been carried
out. Comparison of the simulated indicatrices and indicatrices measured by SFC
showed good agreement, validating the biconcave disk model for a mature RBC. We
simulated the light-scattering output signals from the SFC with the DDA for
RBCs modeled as a disk-sphere and as an oblate spheroid. The biconcave disk,
the disk-sphere, and the oblate spheroid models have been compared for two
orientations, i.e. face-on and rim-on incidence. Only the oblate spheroid model
for rim-on incidence gives results similar to the rigorous biconcave disk
model.
"
0,107,"  I discuss several aspects of information theory and its relationship to
physics and neuroscience. The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay is
the concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity, for
short). I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of finding
algorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin (algorithmic)
Complexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we
call the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on
the observed coherence between multiple sensory input streams and our own
interactions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a model.
"
0,108,"  The subject of collective attention is central to an information age where
millions of people are inundated with daily messages. It is thus of interest to
understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among
large populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among
one million users of an interactive website -- \texttt{digg.com} -- devoted to
thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a
dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements
indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law,
suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.
"
0,109,"  A cylindrical wave expansion method is developed to obtain the scattering
field for an ideal two-dimensional cylindrical invisibility cloak. A near-ideal
model of the invisibility cloak is set up to solve the boundary problem at the
inner boundary of the cloak shell. We confirm that a cloak with the ideal
material parameters is a perfect invisibility cloak by systematically studying
the change of the scattering coefficients from the near-ideal case to the ideal
one. However, due to the slow convergence of the zero$^{th}$ order scattering
coefficients, a tiny perturbation on the cloak would induce a noticeable field
scattering and penetration.
"
0,110,"  Phase singularities as topological objects of wave fields appear in a variety
of physical, chemical, and biological scenarios. In this paper, by making use
of the $\phi$-mapping topological current theory, we study the topological
properties of the phase singularities in two and three dimensional space in
details. The topological inner structure of the phase singularities are
obtained, and the topological charge of the phase singularities are expressed
by the topological numbers: Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees. Furthermore, the
topological invariant of the closed and knotted phase singularities in three
dimensional space are also discussed in details.
"
0,111,"  Carrier wave shocking is studied using the Pseudo-Spectral Spatial Domain
(PSSD) technique. We describe the shock detection diagnostics necessary for
this numerical study, and verify them against theoretical shocking predictions
for the dispersionless case. These predictions show Carrier Envelope Phase
(CEP) and pulse bandwidth sensitivity in the single-cycle regime. The flexible
dispersion management offered by PSSD enables us to independently control the
linear and nonlinear dispersion. Customized dispersion profiles allow us to
analyze the development of both carrier self-steepening and shocks. The results
exhibit a marked asymmetry between normal and anomalous dispersion, both in the
limits of the shocking regime and in the (near) shocked pulse waveforms.
Combining these insights, we offer some suggestions on how carrier shocking (or
at least extreme self-steepening) might be realised experimentally.
"
0,112,"  The large-scale organization of the world economies is exhibiting
increasingly levels of local heterogeneity and global interdependency.
Understanding the relation between local and global features calls for
analytical tools able to uncover the global emerging organization of the
international trade network. Here we analyze the world network of bilateral
trade imbalances and characterize its overall flux organization, unraveling
local and global high-flux pathways that define the backbone of the trade
system. We develop a general procedure capable to progressively filter out in a
consistent and quantitative way the dominant trade channels. This procedure is
completely general and can be applied to any weighted network to detect the
underlying structure of transport flows. The trade fluxes properties of the
world trade web determines a ranking of trade partnerships that highlights
global interdependencies, providing information not accessible by simple local
analysis. The present work provides new quantitative tools for a dynamical
approach to the propagation of economic crises.
"
0,113,"  We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)
dumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate
Reynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a
set of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The
dynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.
Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an
additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both
components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way
coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of
motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow
for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by
Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in
our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic
properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy
budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to
20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the
dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,
increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry
of the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the
streamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched
referentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate
the local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.
"
0,114,"  A random matrix model to describe the coupling of m-fold symmetry in
constructed. The particular threefold case is used to analyze data on
eigenfrequencies of elastomechanical vibration of an anisotropic quartz block.
It is suggested that such experimental/theoretical study may supply powerful
means to discern intrinsic symmetries in physical systems.
"
0,115,"  We demonstrate an all-optical delay line in hot cesium vapor that tunably
delays 275 ps input pulses up to 6.8 ns and 740 input ps pulses up to 59 ns
(group index of approximately 200) with little pulse distortion. The delay is
made tunable with a fast reconfiguration time (hundreds of ns) by optically
pumping out of the atomic ground states.
"
0,116,"  Systematic error in calculation of z for high redshift type Ia supernovae
could help explain unexpected luminosity values that indicate an accelerating

"
0,117,"  We show that full-image micro-PIV analysis in combination with images of
transient particle motion is a powerful tool for experimental studies of
acoustic radiation forces and acoustic streaming in microfluidic chambers under
piezo-actuation in the MHz range. The measured steady-state motion of both
large 5 um and small 1 um particles can be understood in terms of the acoustic
eigenmodes or standing ultra-sound waves in the given experimental
microsystems. This interpretation is supported by numerical solutions of the
corresponding acoustic wave equation.
"
0,118,"  This paper introduces a theory about the role of language in learning
physics. The theory is developed in the context of physics students' and
physicists' talking and writing about the subject of quantum mechanics. We
found that physicists' language encodes different varieties of analogical
models through the use of grammar and conceptual metaphor. We hypothesize that
students categorize concepts into ontological categories based on the
grammatical structure of physicists' language. We also hypothesize that
students over-extend and misapply conceptual metaphors in physicists' speech
and writing. Using our theory, we will show how, in some cases, we can explain
student difficulties in quantum mechanics as difficulties with language.
"
0,119,"  Microfluidic chips have been fabricated to study electrokinetic pumping
generated by a low voltage AC signal applied to an asymmetric electrode array.
A measurement procedure has been established and followed carefully resulting
in a high degree of reproducibility of the measurements. Depending on the ionic
concentration as well as the amplitude of the applied voltage, the observed
direction of the DC flow component is either forward or reverse. The impedance
spectrum has been thoroughly measured and analyzed in terms of an equivalent
circuit diagram. Our observations agree qualitatively, but not quantitatively,
with theoretical models published in the literature.
"
0,120,"  In this letter I suggest possible redefinition of mass density, not depending
on speed of the mass element, which leads to a more simple stress-energy for an

"
0,121,"  A set of analog electronics boards for serial readout of silicon strip
sensors was fabricated. A commercially available amplifier is mounted on a
homemade hybrid board in order to receive analog signals from silicon strip
sensors. Also, another homemade circuit board is fabricated in order to
translate amplifier control signals into a suitable format and to provide bias
voltage to the amplifier as well as to the silicon sensors. We discuss
technical details of the fabrication process and performance of the circuit
boards we developed.
"
0,122,"  In this paper, we consider daily financial data of a collection of different
stock market indices, exchange rates, and interest rates, and we analyze their
multi-scaling properties by estimating a simple specification of the
Markov-switching multifractal model (MSM). In order to see how well the
estimated models capture the temporal dependence of the data, we estimate and
compare the scaling exponents $H(q)$ (for $q = 1, 2$) for both empirical data
and simulated data of the estimated MSM models. In most cases the multifractal
model appears to generate `apparent' long memory in agreement with the
empirical scaling laws.
"
0,123,"  An accurate experimental investigation on the Mpemba effect (that is, the
freezing of initially hot water before cold one) is carried out, showing that
in the adiabatic cooling of water a relevant role is played by supercooling as
well as by phase transitions taking place at 6 +/- 1 oC, 3.5 +/- 0.5 oC and 1.3
+/- 0.6 oC, respectively. The last transition, occurring with a non negligible
probability of 0.21, has not been detected earlier. Supported by the
experimental results achieved, a thorough theoretical analysis of supercooling
and such phase transitions, which are interpreted in terms of different
ordering of clusters of molecules in water, is given.
"
0,124,"  We investigate the possibility to deduce momentum space properties from
time-dependent density functional calculations. Electron and ion momentum
distributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong
few-cycle laser pulse are studied. We show that, in this case, the choice of
suitable functionals for the observables is considerably more important than
the choice of the correlation potential in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham
equations. By comparison with the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is
demonstrated. We construct a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, which in
principle yields the exact momentum distributions of the electrons and the ion.
The product-phase approximation is introduced, which reduces the problem of
approximating this functional significantly.
"
0,125,"  Star patterns, reminiscent of a wide range of diffusively controlled growth
forms from snowflakes to Saffman-Taylor fingers, are ubiquitous features of ice
covered lakes. Despite the commonality and beauty of these ``lake stars'' the
underlying physical processes that produce them have not been explained in a
coherent theoretical framework. Here we describe a simple mathematical model
that captures the principal features of lake-star formation; radial fingers of
(relatively warm) water-rich regions grow from a central source and evolve
through a competition between thermal and porous media flow effects in a
saturated snow layer covering the lake. The number of star arms emerges from a
stability analysis of this competition and the qualitative features of this
meter-scale natural phenomena are captured in laboratory experiments.
"
0,126,"  We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial
entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular
momentum and the magnitude of the transverse (radial) wave vectors. Both
degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only
requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection
analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by
our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent
experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of
twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number
is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional
entanglement.
"
0,127,"  We report the suppression of loss of surface plasmon polariton propagating at
the interface between silver film and optically pumped polymer with dye. Large
magnitude of the effect enables a variety of applications of ""active""
nanoplasmonics. The experimental study is accompanied by the development of the
analytical description of the phenomenon and the solution of the controversy
regarding the direction of the wavevector of a wave with a strong evanescent
component in an active medium.
"
0,128,"  The Special Theory of Relativity and the Theory of the Electron have had an
interesting history together. Originally the electron was studied in a non
relativistic context and this opened up the interesting possibility that lead
to the conclusion that the mass of the electron could be thought of entirely in
electromagnetic terms without introducing inertial considerations. However the
application of Special Relativity lead to several problems, both for an
extended electron and the point electron. These inconsistencies have, contrary
to popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within the
context of Quantum Theory. Nevertheless these and subsequent studies bring out
the interesting result that Special Relativity breaks down within the Compton
scale or when the Compton scale is not neglected. This again runs contrary to
an uncritical notion that Special Relativity is valid for point particles.
"
0,129,"  We consider the ferromagnetic large-$q$ state Potts model in complex evolving
networks, which is equivalent to an optimal cooperation problem, in which the
agents try to optimize the total sum of pair cooperation benefits and the
supports of independent projects. The agents are found to be typically of two
kinds: a fraction of $m$ (being the magnetization of the Potts model) belongs
to a large cooperating cluster, whereas the others are isolated one man's
projects. It is shown rigorously that the homogeneous model has a strongly
first-order phase transition, which turns to second-order for random
interactions (benefits), the properties of which are studied numerically on the
Barab\'asi-Albert network. The distribution of finite-size transition points is
characterized by a shift exponent, $1/\tilde{\nu}'=.26(1)$, and by a different
width exponent, $1/\nu'=.18(1)$, whereas the magnetization at the transition
point scales with the size of the network, $N$, as: $m\sim N^{-x}$, with
$x=.66(1)$.
"
0,130,"  The spectral function of the closed-shell Neon atom is computed by expanding
the electron self-energy through a set of Faddeev equations. This method
describes the coupling of single-particle degrees of freedom with correlated
two-electron, two-hole, and electron-hole pairs. The excitation spectra are
obtained using the Random Phase Approximation, rather than the Tamm-Dancoff
framework employed in the third-order algebraic diagrammatic contruction
[ADC(3)] method. The difference between these two approaches is studied, as
well as the interplay between ladder and ring diagrams in the self-energy.
Satisfactory results are obtained for the ionization energies as well as the
energy of the ground state with the Faddeev-RPA scheme that is also appropriate
for the high-density electron gas.
"
0,131,"  We propose a combined experimental (Atomic Force Microscopy) and theoretical
study of the structural and dynamical properties of nucleosomes. In contrast to
biochemical approaches, this method allows to determine simultaneously the DNA
complexed length distribution and nucleosome position in various contexts.
First, we show that differences in the nucleo-proteic structure observed
between conventional H2A and H2A.Bbd variant nucleosomes induce quantitative
changes in the in the length distribution of DNA complexed with histones. Then,
the sliding action of remodeling complex SWI/SNF is characterized through the
evolution of the nucleosome position and wrapped DNA length mapping. Using a
linear energetic model for the distribution of DNA complexed length, we extract
the net wrapping energy of DNA onto the histone octamer, and compare it to
previous studies.
"
0,132,"  Density-functional theory has been applied to investigate systematics of
sodium clusters Na_n in the size range of n= 39-55. A clear evolutionary trend
in the growth of their ground-state geometries emerges. The clusters at the
beginning of the series (n=39-43) are symmetric and have partial icosahedral
(two-shell) structure. The growth then goes through a series of disordered
clusters (n=44-52) where the icosahedral core is lost. However, for n>52 a
three shell icosahedral structure emerges. This change in the nature of the
geometry is abrupt. In addition, density-functional molecular dynamics has been
used to calculate the specific heat curves for the representative sizes n= 43,
45, 48 and 52. These results along with already available thermodynamic
calculations for n= 40, 50, and 55 enable us to carry out a detailed comparison
of the heat capacity curves with their respective geometries for the entire
series. Our results clearly bring out strong correlation between the evolution
of the geometries and the nature of the shape of the heat capacities. The
results also firmly establish the size-sensitive nature of the heat capacities
in sodium clusters.
"
0,133,"  A new public conveyance model applicable to buses and trains is proposed in
this paper by using stochastic cellular automaton. We have found the optimal
density of vehicles, at which the average velocity becomes maximum,
significantly depends on the number of stops and passengers behavior of getting
on a vehicle at stops. The efficiency of the hail-and-ride system is also
discussed by comparing the different behavior of passengers. Moreover, we have
found that a big cluster of vehicles is divided into small clusters, by
incorporating information of the number of vehicles between successive stops.
"
0,134,"  A library of C functions yielding exact solutions of potential and flux
influences due to uniform surface distribution of singularities on flat
triangular and rectangular elements has been developed. This library, ISLES,
has been used to develop the neBEM solver that is both precise and fast in
solving a wide range of problems of scientific and technological interest. Here
we present the exact expressions proposed for computing the influence of
uniform singularity distributions on triangular elements and illustrate their
accuracy. We also present a study concerning the time taken to evaluate these
long and complicated expressions \textit{vis a vis} that spent in carrying out
simple quadratures. Finally, we solve a classic benchmark problem in
electrostatics, namely, estimation of the capacitance of a unit square plate
raised to unit volt. For this problem, we present the estimated values of
capacitance and compare them successfully with some of the most accurate
results available in the literature. In addition, we present the variation of
the charge density close to the corner of the plate for various degrees of
discretization. The variations are found to be smooth and converging. This is
in clear contrast to the criticism commonly leveled against usual BEM solvers.
"
0,135,"  Retarded electromagnetic potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and
the Lorenz condition. The difference found between these potentials and the
conventional Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert ones is explained by neglect, for the latter,
of the motion-dependence of the effective charge density. The corresponding
retarded fields of a point-like charge in arbitary motion are compared with
those given by the formulae of Heaviside, Feynman, Jefimenko and other authors.
The fields of an accelerated charge given by the Feynman are the same as those
derived from the Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials but not those given by the
Jefimenko formulae. A mathematical error concerning partial space and time
derivatives in the derivation of the Jefimenko equations is pointed out.
"
0,136,"  We report that resonant response with a very high quality factor can be
achieved in a planar metamaterial by introducing symmetry breaking in the shape
of its structural elements, which enables excitation of dark modes, i.e. modes
that are weakly coupled to free space.
"
0,137,"  We study Gaussian valence bond states of continuous variable systems,
obtained as the outputs of projection operations from an ancillary space of M
infinitely entangled bonds connecting neighboring sites, applied at each of $N$
sites of an harmonic chain. The entanglement distribution in Gaussian valence
bond states can be controlled by varying the input amount of entanglement
engineered in a (2M+1)-mode Gaussian state known as the building block, which
is isomorphic to the projector applied at a given site. We show how this
mechanism can be interpreted in terms of multiple entanglement swapping from
the chain of ancillary bonds, through the building blocks. We provide optical
schemes to produce bisymmetric three-mode Gaussian building blocks (which
correspond to a single bond, M=1), and study the entanglement structure in the
output Gaussian valence bond states. The usefulness of such states for quantum
communication protocols with continuous variables, like telecloning and
teleportation networks, is finally discussed.
"
0,138,"  We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required
vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted
immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage
of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network
structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of
selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than
himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this
method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a
scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.
"
0,139,"  The evolution of Turkish Journal of Chemistry (Turk J. Chem) Hirsch index
(h-index) over the period 1995-2005 is studied and determined in the case of
the self and without self-citations. It is seen that the effect of Hirsch index
of Turk J. Chem has a highly positive trend during the last five years. It
proves that Turk J. Chem is improving itself both in quantity and quality since
h-index reflects peer review, and peer review reflects research quality of a
journal.
"
0,140,"  We present Cluster measurements of large electric fields correlated with
intense downward field-aligned currents, and show that the data can be
reproduced by a simple model of ionospheric plasma depletion caused by the
currents. This type of magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction may be important
when considering the mapping between these two regions of space.
"
0,141,"  Among the ideas to be conveyed to students in an introductory quantum course,
we have the pivotal idea championed by Dirac that functions correspond to
column vectors (kets) and that differential operators correspond to matrices
(ket-bras) acting on those vectors. The MATLAB (matrix-laboratory) programming
environment is especially useful in conveying these concepts to students
because it is geared towards the type of matrix manipulations useful in solving
introductory quantum physics problems. In this article, we share MATLAB codes
which have been developed at WPI, focusing on 1D problems, to be used in
conjunction with Griffiths' introductory text.
"
0,142,"  Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the
lithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by
mantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external
forces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On
one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an
important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the
deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the
assumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity
and topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the
lithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing
the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable
Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except
for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the
transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include
bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress
functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further
show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness
varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the
degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal
tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell
and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure
equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the
prediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the
construction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.
"
0,143,"  It is shown that fermionic polar molecules or atoms in a bilayer optical
lattice can undergo the transition to a state with circulating currents, which
spontaneously breaks the time reversal symmetry. Estimates of relevant
temperature scales are given and experimental signatures of the circulating
current phase are identified. Related phenomena in bosonic and spin systems
with ring exchange are discussed.
"
0,144,"  The design, construction, and performance of a linear radio-frequency ion
trap (RFQ) intended for use in the Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) are
described. EXO aims to detect the neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{136}$Xe
to $^{136}$Ba. To suppress possible backgrounds EXO will complement the
measurement of decay energy and, to some extent, topology of candidate events
in a Xe filled detector with the identification of the daughter nucleus
($^{136}$Ba). The ion trap described here is capable of accepting, cooling, and
confining individual Ba ions extracted from the site of the candidate
double-beta decay event. A single trapped ion can then be identified, with a
large signal-to-noise ratio, via laser spectroscopy.
"
0,145,"  It is shown that a gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as an ultrahigh
energy particle accelerator that can accelerate particles to energies
inconceivable in any terrestrial particle accelerator, and that when the energy
E of the particles comprising the matter in the black hole is $ \sim 10^{2} $
GeV or more,or equivalently the temperature T is $ \sim 10^{15}$ K or more, the
entire matter in the black hole will be in the form of quark-gluon plasma
permeated by leptons.
"
0,146,"  A critique of the singularity theorems of Penrose, Hawking, and Geroch is
given. It is pointed out that a gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as
an ultrahigh energy particle accelerator that can accelerate particles to
energies inconceivable in any terrestrial particle accelerator, and that when
the energy $E$ of the particles comprising matter in a black hole is $\sim
10^{2} GeV$ or more, or equivalently, the temperature $T$ is $\sim 10^{15} K$
or more, the entire matter in the black hole is converted into quark-gluon
plasma permeated by leptons. As quarks and leptons are fermions, it is
emphasized that the collapse of a black-hole to a space-time singularity is
inhibited by Pauli's exclusion principle. It is also suggested that ultimately
a black hole may end up either as a stable quark star, or as a pulsating quark
star which may be a source of gravitational radiation, or it may simply explode
with a mini bang of a sort.
"
0,147,"  We argue about a possible scenario of physical reality based on the
parallelism between Poincare group and the sunyata philosophy of Nagarjuna. The
notion of ""relational"" is the common denominator of two views. We have
approached the relational concept in third-person perspective (ontic level). It
is possible to deduce different physical consequence and interpretation through
first-person perspective approach. This relational interpretation leave open
the questions: i)we must abandon the idea for a physical system the possibility
to extract completeness information? ii)we must abandon the idea to infer a
possible structure of physical reality?
"
0,148,"  We propose a new theoretical method for the calculation of the interaction
energy between macromolecular systems at large distances. The method provides a
linear scaling of the computing time with the system size and is considered as
an alternative to the well known fast multipole method. Its efficiency,
accuracy and applicability to macromolecular systems is analyzed and discussed
in detail.
"
0,149,"  We use numerical optimization to study the properties of (1) the class of
one-dimensional potential energy functions and (2) systems of point charges in
two-dimensions that yield the largest hyperpolarizabilities, which we find to
be within 30% of the fundamental limit. We investigate the character of the
potential energy functions and resulting wavefunctions and find that a broad
range of potentials yield the same intrinsic hyperpolarizability ceiling of
0.709.
"
0,150,"  Many real systems possess accelerating statistics where the total number of
edges grows faster than the network size. In this paper, we propose a simple
weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical
expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and
weight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that
accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks.
Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a
transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect
to accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the
theoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical
simulations.
"
0,151,"  We develop a class of soliton solution of {\it linear} Schr\""odinger equation
without external potential. The quantum probability density generates its own
boundary inside which there is internal vibration whose wave number is
determined by the velocity of the particle as firstly conjectured by de
Broglie. Assuming resonance of the internal vibration will lead to quantization
of particle's momentum in term of wave number of the envelope quantum
probability density. We further show that the linearity of the Schr\""odinger
equation allows us to have non-interacting many solitons solution through
superposition, each describing a particle with equal mass.
"
0,152,"  Prices of commodities or assets produce what is called time-series. Different
kinds of financial time-series have been recorded and studied for decades.
Nowadays, all transactions on a financial market are recorded, leading to a
huge amount of data available, either for free in the Internet or commercially.
Financial time-series analysis is of great interest to practitioners as well as
to theoreticians, for making inferences and predictions. Furthermore, the
stochastic uncertainties inherent in financial time-series and the theory
needed to deal with them make the subject especially interesting not only to
economists, but also to statisticians and physicists. While it would be a
formidable task to make an exhaustive review on the topic, with this review we
try to give a flavor of some of its aspects.
"
0,153,"  We demonstrate existence of waves localized at the interface of two nonlinear
periodic media with different coefficients of the cubic nonlinearity via the
one-dimensional Gross--Pitaevsky equation. We call these waves the surface gap
solitons (SGS). In the case of smooth symmetric periodic potentials, we study
analytically bifurcations of SGS's from standard gap solitons and determine
numerically the maximal jump of the nonlinearity coefficient allowing for the
SGS existence. We show that the maximal jump vanishes near the thresholds of
bifurcations of gap solitons. In the case of continuous potentials with a jump
in the first derivative at the interface, we develop a homotopy method of
continuation of SGS families from the solution obtained via gluing of parts of
the standard gap solitons and study existence of SGS's in the photonic band
gaps. We explain the termination of the SGS families in the interior points of
the band gaps from the bifurcation of linear bound states in the continuous
non-smooth potentials.
"
0,154,"  As networks and their structure have become a major field of research, a
strong demand for network visualization has emerged. We address this challenge
by formalizing the well established spring layout in terms of dynamic
equations. We thus open up the design space for new algorithms. Drawing from
the knowledge of systems design, we derive a layout algorithm that remedies
several drawbacks of the original spring layout. This new algorithm relies on
the balancing of two antagonistic forces. We thus call it {\em arf} for
""attractive and repulsive forces"". It is, as we claim, particularly suited for
a dynamic layout of smaller networks ($n < 10^3$). We back this claim with
several application examples from on going complex systems research.
"
0,155,"  Axisymmetric equilibria with incompressible flows of arbitrary direction are
studied in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics under a variety of physically
relevant side conditions. To this end a set of pertinent non-linear ODEs are
transformed to quasilinear ones and the respective initial value problem is
solved numerically with appropriately determined initial values near the
magnetic axis. Several equilibria are then constructed surface by surface. The
non field aligned flow results in novel configurations with a single magnetic
axis, toroidal shell configurations in which the plasma is confined within a
couple of magnetic surfaces and double shell-like configurations. In addition,
the flow affects the elongation and triangularity of the magnetic surfaces.
"
0,156,"  In the present letter we suggest a new theoretical model for a quantitative
description of the magnetoreception mechanism in birds. The considered
mechanism involves two types of iron minerals (magnetite and maghemite) which
were found in subcellular compartments within sensory dendrites of the upper
beak of several bird species. The analysis of forces acting between the iron
particles shows that the orientation of the external geomagnetic field can
significantly change the probability of the mechanosensitive ion channels
opening and closing. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the
suggested magnetoreceptor system might be a sensitive biological magnetometer
providing an essential part of the magnetic map for navigation.
"
0,157,"  Generalization of the Kac integral and Kac method for paths measure based on
the Levy distribution has been used to derive fractional diffusion equation.
Application to nonlinear fractional Ginzburg-Landau equation is discussed.
"
0,158,"  Admitting the validity of Lorentz transformations for the space as time
coordinates of the same event we derive their differential form in order to
underline the correct prerequisites for the application of time and length
contraction or dilation effects. Furthermore we quantify the simultaneity error
occurring in the relativity theory. Having done this, we analyse the root cause
of these effects and identify it with a finite phase velocity associated with
the moving frame. We define this phase velocity by analogy to the de Broglie
wave associated with a moving particle. Based on this construct we demonstrate
that the phase of the de Broglie waves further extended for stationary
particles is a relativistic invariant being the same for all corresponding
observers. Also the phase of the electromagnetic waves transporting energy at
light speed is a relativistic invariant. Therefore the universe and its matter
/ energy may be seen as a superposition of waves propagating such that their
phase is the same for all corresponding observers. The wave phase may replace
the time as an invariant and universal reference.
"
0,159,"  This paper describes the appearance of abnormal film thickness features
formed in elastohydrodynamic contacts lubricated by a fatty alcohol.
Experiments were conducted by varying the slide to roll ratio between a steel
ball and a glass disk in a ball-on-disk type device. Lauric alcohol was used as
lubricant and film thickness was measured in the contact area by optical
interferometry. Experimental results showed that the film thickness
distributions under pure rolling conditions remained classical whereas the film
shape changed when the slide to roll ratio was increased. The thickness in the
central contact area increased and in the same time inlet and exit film
thicknesses were modified. In addition, the film shapes observed when the ball
surface was moving faster than the disk one and those obtained in the opposite
case were different, i.e. when opposite signs but equal absolute values of the
slide to roll ratio were applied.
"
0,160,"  A conclusive demonstration has been provided that the nature of the
shear-thinning, that affects both film thickness and traction in EHL contacts,
follows the ordinary power-law rule that has been described by many empirical
models of which Carreau is but one example. This was accomplished by accurate
measurements in viscometers of the shear response of a PAO that possesses a
very low critical stress for shear-thinning and accurate measurements
in-contact of film thickness and traction under conditions which accentuate the
shear-thinning effect. The in-contact central film thickness and traction were
entirely predictable from the rheological properties obtained from viscometers
using simple calculations. These data should be invaluable to researchers
endeavoring to accurately simulate Hertz zone behavior since the shear-thinning
rheology is extensively characterized and accurate in-contact data are
available to test. In addition, a new model has been introduced that may be
useful for the rheological characterization of mixtures.
"
0,161,"  After the pioneered experimental works on superlubricity by Martin et al. on
MoS2 [1], Hirano et al. on tungsten and silicon [2] and the further
confirmation by Dienwiebel et al. on graphite [3], many groups around the word
investigated the occurrence of near frictionless sliding contacts. This large
mobilization of tribologists, material sciences specialists and physicists has
lead to emerging solutions involving new materials and coatings, the most
promising being carbon based like graphite, diamond, carbon composites or
diamond-like-carbons. Some of them are currently used in practical
applications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highest
friction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e.
fluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and they
vary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation is
consequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared to
those obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a super
low traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially in
the case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales. This weak
perspective could be one explanation on the relatively low number of articles
in recent literature dealing with lubricated superlubricity in the above
conditions.
"
0,162,"  A lead-glass hodoscope calorimeter that was constructed for use in the
Jefferson Lab Real Compton Scattering experiment is described. The detector
provides a measurement of the coordinates and the energy of scattered photons
in the GeV energy range with resolutions of 5 mm and 6%/\sqrt(E{\gamma} [GeV]).
Features of both the detector design and its performance in the high luminosity
environment during the experiment are presented.
"
0,163,"  We compute the stationary in-degree probability, $P_{in}(k)$, for a growing
network model with directed edges and arbitrary out-degree probability. In
particular, under preferential linking, we find that if the nodes have a light
tail (finite variance) out-degree distribution, then the corresponding
in-degree one behaves as $k^{-3}$. Moreover, for an out-degree distribution
with a scale invariant tail, $P_{out}(k)\sim k^{-\alpha}$, the corresponding
in-degree distribution has exactly the same asymptotic behavior only if
$2<\alpha<3$ (infinite variance). Similar results are obtained when
attractiveness is included. We also present some results on descriptive
statistics measures %descriptive statistics such as the correlation between the
number of in-going links, $D_{in}$, and outgoing links, $D_{out}$, and the
conditional expectation of $D_{in}$ given $D_{out}$, and we calculate these
measures for the WWW network. Finally, we present an application to the
scientific publications network. The results presented here can explain the
tail behavior of in/out-degree distribution observed in many real networks.
"
0,164,"  Students, after they leave our care, are called to solve the diverse problems
of the world, so we should teach to increase transfer: the ability to apply
fundamental principles to new problems and contexts. This ability is rare. The
following pages are from a workshop for faculty on designing courses that
promote transfer. I discuss two design principles: to name the transferable
ideas and to illustrate them with examples from diverse subjects. The
discussion uses dimensional reasoning as the example of a valuable transferable
idea, illustrating it with three diverse examples.
"
0,165,"  Distributions following a power-law are an ubiquitous phenomenon. Methods for
determining the exponent of a power-law tail by graphical means are often used
in practice but are intrinsically unreliable. Maximum likelihood estimators for
the exponent are a mathematically sound alternative to graphical methods.
"
0,166,"  The holographic upper bound on entropy is applied to the gravitational action
associated with the non-relativistic contraction of a nebula. A critical radius
is identified, as a function of the initial radius and mass, for which the
number of bits associated with the action would equal the maximum number of
bits allowed to the body. The gravitational action of a typical star
approximately saturates the holographic bound, perhaps suggesting a physical
link between holographic principles and astrophysical processes.
"
0,167,"  We present a method of computing Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries,
with any desired accuracy, that can directly exploit the efficiency of standard
numerical-electromagnetism techniques. Using the simplest possible
finite-difference implementation of this approach, we obtain both agreement
with past results for cylinder-plate geometries, and also present results for
new geometries. In particular, we examine a piston-like problem involving two
dielectric and metallic squares sliding between two metallic walls, in two and
three dimensions, respectively, and demonstrate non-additive and non-monotonic
changes in the force due to these lateral walls.
"
0,168,"  Normal-incidence transmission and dispersion properties of optical
multilayers and one-dimensional stepwise potential barriers in the
non-tunneling regime are analytically investigated. The optical paths of every
constituent layer in a multilayer structure, as well as the parameters of every
step of the stepwise potential barrier, are constrained by a generalized
quarter-wave condition. No other restrictions on the structure geometry is
imposed, i.e., the layers are arranged arbitrarily. We show that the density of
states (DOS) spectra of the multilayer or barrier in question are subject to
integral conservation rules similar to the Barnett-Loudon sum rule but ocurring
within a finite frequency or energy interval. In the optical case, these
frequency intervals are regular. For the potential barriers, only non-periodic
energy intervals can be present in the spectrum of any given structure, and
only if the parameters of constituent potential steps are properly chosen.
  Abstract The integral conservation relations derived analytically have also
been verified numerically. The relations can be used in dispersion-engineered
multilayer-based devices, e.g., ultrashort pulse compressors or ultracompact
optical delay lines, as well as to design multiple-quantum-well electronic
heterostructures with engineered DOS.
"
0,169,"  A practical introduction to stochastic modelling of reaction-diffusion
processes is presented. No prior knowledge of stochastic simulations is
assumed. The methods are explained using illustrative examples. The article
starts with the classical Gillespie algorithm for the stochastic modelling of
chemical reactions. Then stochastic algorithms for modelling molecular
diffusion are given. Finally, basic stochastic reaction-diffusion methods are
presented. The connections between stochastic simulations and deterministic
models are explained and basic mathematical tools (e.g. chemical master
equation) are presented. The article concludes with an overview of more
advanced methods and problems.
"
0,170,"  Data on the prevalence of bone cancer in dinosaurs is available from past
radiological examination of preserved bones. We statistically test this data
for consistency with rates extrapolated from information on bone cancer in
modern vertebrates, and find that there is no evidence of a different rate.
Thus, this test provides no support for a possible role of ionizing radiation
in the K-T extinction event.
"
0,171,"  We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model
(LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have
previously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to
observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial
range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the
predicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy
spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as
k^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the
sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure
in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in
different spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is
subdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible
for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no
internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS
attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either
for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a
formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully
converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct
numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance
between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead
of the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS
contributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower
energy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude
LANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.
"
0,172,"  This paper revisits previous papers related to the theory of relativity.
Afterwards, a reconsideration of the hypothesis of ether-dragging is discussed.
The ether is compatible with the theory of relativity and historical
experiments; this paper explains the Michelson-Morley experiment using the
ether-dragging hypothesis without the orthodox interpretation that the speed c
is a fixed constant in terms of any system of inertial coordinates.
"
0,173,"  In this paper, we used the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock method to compute
with high precision the influence of the hyperfine interaction on the
$[Ar]3d^{10} 4s4p ^3P_0$ level lifetime in Zn-like ions for stable and some
quasi-stable isotopes of nonzero nuclear spin between Z=30 and Z=92. The
influence of this interaction on the $[Ar]3d^{10} 4s4p ^3P_1 - [Ar]3d^{10} 4s4p
^3P_0$ separation energy is also calculated for the same ions.
"
0,174,"  Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and
characterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We
experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square,
pentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant
peaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic
orbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take
into account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental
and numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation
of long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the
two-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with
micro-disks.
"
0,175,"  We study cascading failures in networks using a dynamical flow model based on
simple conservation and distribution laws to investigate the impact of
transient dynamics caused by the rebalancing of loads after an initial network
failure (triggering event). It is found that considering the flow dynamics may
imply reduced network robustness compared to previous static overload failure
models. This is due to the transient oscillations or overshooting in the loads,
when the flow dynamics adjusts to the new (remaining) network structure. We
obtain {\em upper} and {\em lower} limits to network robustness, and it is
shown that {\it two} time scales $\tau$ and $\tau_0$, defined by the network
dynamics, are important to consider prior to accurately addressing network
robustness or vulnerability. The robustness of networks showing cascading
failures is generally determined by a complex interplay between the network
topology and flow dynamics, where the ratio $\chi=\tau/\tau_0$ determines the
relative role of the two of them.
"
0,176,"  The influence of excited-state absorption (ESA) and two-exciton processes on
a coherent population transfer with intense ultrashort chirped pulses in
molecular systems in solution has been studied. An unified treatment of
adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) in such systems has been developed using a
three-state electronic system with relaxation treated as a diffusion on
electronic potential energy surfaces. We have shown that ESA has a profound
effect on coherent population transfer in large molecules that necessitates a
more accurate interpretation of experimental data. A simple and physically
clear model for ARP in molecules with three electronic states in solution has
been developed by extending the Landau-Zener calculations putting in a third
level to random crossing of levels. A method for quantum control of two-exciton
states in molecular complexes has been proposed.
"
0,177,"  We report on the frequency performance of a low cost (~500$) radio-frequency
sine wave generator, using direct digital synthesis (DDS) and a
field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The output frequency of the device may be
changed dynamically to any arbitrary value ranging from DC to 10 MHz without
any phase slip. Sampling effects are substantially reduced by a high sample
rate, up to 1 MHz, and by a large memory length, more than 2.10^5 samples. By
using a low noise external oscillator to clock the DDS, we demonstrate a phase
noise as low as that of the master clock, that is at the level of -113
dB.rad^2/Hz at 1 Hz from the carrier for an output frequency of 3.75 MHz. The
device is successfully used to confine an ultracold atomic cloud of rubidium 87
in a RF-based trap, and there is no extra heating from the RF source.
"
0,178,"  The general relativity is the base for any exact evolutionary theory of large
scale structures. We calculate the universal 2+1-dimensional plane equations of
gravitational field in general relativity. Based on the equations, the
evolutions of disk nebula are discussed. A system of nebula can form binary
stars or single star for different conditions. While any simplified linear
theory forms only a single star system. It is proved that the nonlinear
interactions are very general, so the binary stars are also common.
"
0,179,"  After negative temperature is restated, we find that it will derive
necessarily decrease of entropy. Negative temperature is based on the Kelvin
scale and the condition dU>0 and dS<0. Conversely, there is also negative
temperature for dU<0 and dS>0. But, negative temperature is contradiction with
usual meaning of temperature and with some basic concepts of physics and
mathematics. It is a question in nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We proposed a
possibility of decrease of entropy due to fluctuation magnified and internal
interactions in some isolated systems. From this we discuss some possible
examples and theories.
"
0,180,"  This paper is a detailed report on a programme of simulations used to settle
a long-standing issue in the dynamo theory and demonstrate that the fluctuation
dynamo exists in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds number Rm>>1 and small
magnetic Prandtl number Pm<<1. The dependence of the critical Rm_c vs. the
hydrodynamic Reynolds number Re is obtained for 1<Re<6700. In the limit Pm<<1,
Rm_c is ~3 times larger than for Pm>1. The stability curve Rm_c(Re) (and, it is
argued, the nature of the dynamo) is substantially different from the case of
the simulations and liquid-metal experiments with a mean flow. It is not as yet
possible to determine numerically whether the growth rate is ~Rm^{1/2} in the
limit Re>>Rm>>1, as should be the case if the dynamo is driven by the
inertial-range motions. The magnetic-energy spectrum in the low-Pm regime is
qualitatively different from the Pm>1 case and appears to develop a negative
spectral slope, although current resolutions are insufficient to determine its
asymptotic form. At 1<Rm<Rm_c, the magnetic fluctuations induced via the
tangling by turbulence of a weak mean field are investigated and the
possibility of a k^{-1} spectrum above the resistive scale is examined. At low
Rm<1, the induced fluctuations are well described by the quasistatic
approximation; the k^{-11/3} spectrum is confirmed for the first time in direct
numerical simulations.
"
0,181,"  The dynamics of many socioeconomic systems is determined by the decision
making process of agents. The decision process depends on agent's
characteristics, such as preferences, risk aversion, behavioral biases, etc..
In addition, in some systems the size of agents can be highly heterogeneous
leading to very different impacts of agents on the system dynamics. The large
size of some agents poses challenging problems to agents who want to control
their impact, either by forcing the system in a given direction or by hiding
their intentionality. Here we consider the financial market as a model system,
and we study empirically how agents strategically adjust the properties of
large orders in order to meet their preference and minimize their impact. We
quantify this strategic behavior by detecting scaling relations of allometric
nature between the variables characterizing the trading activity of different
institutions. We observe power law distributions in the investment time
horizon, in the number of transactions needed to execute a large order and in
the traded value exchanged by large institutions and we show that heterogeneity
of agents is a key ingredient for the emergence of some aggregate properties
characterizing this complex system.
"
0,182,"  The ordered addition of two Lorentz boosts is normally shown to result in a
boost by utilizing concepts from group theory and non-Euclidian geometry. We
present a method for achieving this addition by performing a sequence of
spatial rotations and uni-dimensional Lorentz transformations. The method is
first developed for two-dimensional space and it is then extended to
three-dimensional space by utilizing the commutative property of the rotation
of the y-z plane and a boost along the x-axis. The method employs only matrix
multiplication and certain invariant quantities that are natural consequences
of spatial rotations and Lorentz transformations. The combining of two boosts
in different directions into a single boost cannot be expected a priori because
we show that the converse of this statement is not true. That is, two rotations
interspersed with a boost cannot always be reduced to a single rotation
preceded and followed by boosts.
"
0,183,"  Contact electrification and triboelectrification are well-known in the case
of dissimilar materials, however the case of charge exchange during friction
between nominally identical insulating materials is less documented. We
experimentally investigated the triboelectrification between two smooth
monocrystalline &#945;-Al 2O 3 (sapphire) antagonists by surface force
measurements with a Surface Force Apparatus (SFA). The force between a sphere
and a plane, both in sapphire, was measured as a function of the sphere-plane
distance D, before and after nano-friction tests, under dry argon atmosphere.
Respective contributions of van der Waals, water meniscus and electrostatic
forces were determined. The estimated Hamaker constant was in good agreement
with the Lifshitz theory, and the dominant meniscus attraction at low
separation could be overcome with small radius sphere. We demonstrated that
electrostatic forces were generated by the nano-friction test and we quantified
the adhesion that results from this contact-electrification. In the first stage
of the unloading process, the short range electrostatic force was found to vary
both with time and distance D. Experimental results were correlated with
surface densities of mobile charges on the two surfaces, and the
time-dependence was related to classical surface transport phenomena on alumina
surfaces.
"
0,184,"  Starting from the governing equations for a quantum magnetoplasma including
the quantum Bohm potential and electron spin-1/2 effects, we show that the
system of quantum magnetohydrodynamic (QMHD) equations admit rarefactive
solitons due to the balance between nonlinearities and quantum
diffraction/tunneling effects. It is found that the electron spin-1/2 effect
introduces a pressure-like term with negative sign in the QMHD equations, which
modifies the shape of the solitary magnetosonic waves and makes them wider and
shallower. Numerical simulations of the time-dependent system shows the
development of rarefactive QMHD solitary waves that are modified by the spin
effects.
"
0,185,"  The frequency distribution of DNA bases A, C, G, T exhibit fractal
fluctuations ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature. The power spectra of
fractal fluctuations exhibit inverse power law form signifying long-range
correlations between local (small-scale) and global (large-scale)
perturbations. The author has developed a general systems theory based on
classical statistical physics for fractal fluctuations which predicts that the
probability distribution of eddy amplitudes and the variance (square of eddy
amplitude)spectrum of fractal fluctuations follow the universal Boltzmann
inverse power law expressed as a function of the golden mean. The model
predicted distribution is very close to statistical normal distribution for
fluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean and exhibits a fat
long tail. In this paper it is shown that DNA base CG frequency distribution in
Takifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) Genome Release 4 exhibit universal inverse
power law form consistent with model prediction. The observed long-range
correlations in the DNA bases implies that the non-coding 'junk' or 'selfish'
DNA which appear to be redundant, may also contribute to the efficient
functioning of the protein coding DNA, a result supported by recent studies.
"
0,186,"  The cross-correlations between price fluctuations of 201 frequently traded
stocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this
paper. We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides
with the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization.
The eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\mathbf{C}$, of
NSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds
expected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time
series. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest
is identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that
occur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with
specific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the
Indian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie
much closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack
of distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks
dominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit
construction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the
minimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using
an improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode
and random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed
markets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to
the same business sector. This is consistent with the general belief that
emerging markets tend to be more correlated than developed markets.
"
0,187,"  In many professons employees are rewarded according to their relative
performance. Corresponding economy can be modeled by taking $N$ independent
agents who gain from the market with a rate which depends on their current
gain. We argue that this simple realistic rate generates a scale free
distribution even though intrinsic ability of agents are marginally different
from each other. As an evidence we provide distribution of scores for two
different systems (a) the global stock game where players invest in real stock
market and (b) the international cricket.
"
0,188,"  We have recorded fluorescence spectra of the atomic rubidium D-lines in the
presence of several hundreds of bars buffer gas pressure. With additional
saturation broadening a spectral linewidth comparable to the thermal energy of
the atoms in the heated gas cell is achieved. An intensity-dependent blue
asymmetry of the spectra is observed, which becomes increasingly pronounced
when extrapolating to infinitely high light intensity. We interpret our results
as evidence for the dressed (coupled atom-light) states to approach thermal
equilibrium.
"
0,189,"  Photonic molecules, named by analogy with chemical molecules, are clusters of
closely located electromagnetically interacting microcavities or ""photonic
atoms"". As two or several microcavities are brought close together, their
optical modes interact, and a rich spectrum of photonic molecule supermodes
emerges, which depends both on geometrical and material properties of
individual cavities and on their mutual interactions. Here, we discuss ways of
controllable manipulation of photonic molecule supermodes, which improve or add
new functionalities to microcavity-based optical components. We present several
optimally-tuned photonic molecule designs for lowering thresholds of
semiconductor microlasers, producing directional light emission, enhancing
sensitivity of microcavity-based bio(chemical)sensors, and optimizing
electromagnetic energy transfer around bends of coupled-cavity waveguides.
Photonic molecules composed of identical microcavities as well as of
microcavities with various degrees of size or material detuning are discussed.
Microwave experiments on scaled photonic molecule structures are currently
under way to confirm our theoretical predictions.
"
0,190,"  We study electric potential of a charge placed in a strong magnetic field
B>>4.4x10^{13}G, as modified by the vacuum polarization. In such field the
electron Larmour radius is much less than its Compton length. At the Larmour
distances a scaling law occurs, with the potential determined by a
magnetic-field-independent function. The scaling regime implies short-range
interaction, expressed by Yukawa law. The electromagnetic interaction regains
its long-range character at distances larger than the Compton length, the
potential decreasing across the magnetic field faster than along. Correction to
the nonrelativistic ground-state energy of a hydrogenlike atom is found. In the
infinite-magnetic-field limit the modified potential becomes the Dirac
delta-function plus a regular background. With this potential the ground-state
energy is finite - the best pronounced effect of the vacuum polarization.
"
0,191,"  This paper uses firm-level data recorded in the AMADEUS database to
investigate the distribution of labour productivity in different European
countries. We find that the upper tail of the empirical productivity
distributions follows a decaying power-law, whose exponent $\alpha$ is obtained
by a semi-parametric estimation technique recently developed by Clementi et al.
(2006). The emergence of ""fat tails"" in productivity distribution has already
been detected in Di Matteo et al. (2005) and explained by means of a model of
social network. Here we show that this model is tested on a broader sample of
countries having different patterns of social network structure. These
different social attitudes, measured using a social capital indicator, reflect
in the power-law exponent estimates, verifying in this way the existence of
linkages among firms' productivity performance and social network.
"
0,192,"  We study thermal Casimir and quantum non-retarded Lifshitz interactions
between dielectrics in general geometries. We map the calculation of the
classical partition function onto a determinant which we discretize and
evaluate with the help of Cholesky factorization. The quantum partition
function is treated by path integral quantization of a set of interacting
dipoles and reduces to a product of determinants. We compare the approximations
of pairwise additivity and proximity force with our numerical methods. We
propose a ``factorization approximation'' which gives rather good numerical
results in the geometries that we study.
"
0,193,"  An acousto-optic cell was used to reduce the speckle noise that reduces the
quality of Hartmann-Shack and other wave-front sensors measuring ocular
aberrations. In the method presented here, a laser beam traverses an
acousto-optic cell, interacting with standing acoustic waves. Speckle reduction
takes place as the incoming beam is diffractively spread across the cornea. The
increased size and the wider angular spread of the incoming beam average out
the speckles, producing a more uniform response of the wave-front sensor.
"
0,194,"  We present a generalization of the pioneering results obtained for single
K-shell photoionization of H-like ions by M. Stobbe [Ann. Phys. 7 (1930) 661]
to the case of the helium isoelectronic sequence. The total cross section of
the process is calculated, taking into account the correlation corrections to
first order of the perturbation theory with respect to the electron-electron
interaction. Predictions are made for the entire non-relativistic energy
domain. The phenomenon of dynamical suppression of correlation effects in the
ionization cross section is discussed.
"
0,195,"  The principal limits for the accuracy of the resonance frequency measurements
set by the asymmetry of the natural resonance line shape are studied and
applied to the recent accurate frequency measurements in the two-photon 1s-2s
resonance and in the one-photon 1s-2p resonance in hydrogen atom. This limit
for 1s-2s resonance is found to be $\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz compared to the accuracy
achieved in experiment $\pm 46$ Hz. In case of deuterium atom the limit is
essentially larger: $10^{-2}$ Hz. For 1s-2p resonance the accuracy limit is
0.17 MHz while the uncertainty of the recent frequency measurement is about 6
MHz.
"
0,196,"  Analytical relationships for the surface and curvature energies of oblate and
prolate semi-spheroidal atomic clusters have been obtained. By modifying the
cluster shape from a spheroid to a semi-spheroid the most stable shape was
changed from a sphere to a superdeformed prolate semi-spheroid (including the
flat surface of the end cap). Potential energy surfaces vs. deformation and the
number of atoms, N, illustrate this property independent of N.
"
0,197,"  Potential energy curves for excited leptonic states of the
helium-antihydrogen system are calculated within Ritz' variational approach. An
explicitly correlated ansatz for the leptonic wave function is employed
describing accurately the motion of the leptons (two electrons and positron) in
the field of the helium nucleus and of the antiproton with arbitrary orbital
angular momentum projection $\Lambda$ onto the internuclear axis. Results for
$\Lambda$=0, 1 and 30 are presented. For quasibound states with large values of
$\Lambda$ and rotational quantum numbers $J>\Lambda$ no annihilation and
rearrangement decay channels occur, i. e. they are metastable.
"
0,198,"  We study semi-analytically and in a consistent manner, the generation of a
mean velocity field $\bar{\mathbf{U}}$ by helical MHD turbulence, and the
effect that this field can have on a Mean Field Dynamo. Assuming a prescribed,
maximally helical small scale velocity field, we show that large scale flows
can be generated in MHD turbulent flows, via small scale Lorentz force. These
flows back-react on the mean electromotive force of a Mean Field Dynamo through
new terms, leaving the original $\alpha $ and $\beta $ terms explicitly
unmodified. Cross-helicity plays the key role in interconnecting all the
effects. In the minimal $\tau$ closure that we chose to work with, the effects
are stronger for large relaxation times.
"
0,199,"  My object in the present paper is to: (1) introduce physicists to the life
and work of Whitehead; (2) outline the content of his book ""The Principle of
Relativity""; (3) present Whitehead's basic criticism of the General Theory of
Relativity which, to my mind, has never been rebutted or properly appreciated,
even by GTR specialists; (4) propose a significant relevant research problem;
and (5) summarize some of the rather radical implications of the acceptance of
Whitehead's observations, including that spacetime is not curved.
"
0,200,"  We continue our study of chaotic mixing and transport of passive particles in
a simple model of a meandering jet flow [Prants, et al, Chaos {\bf 16}, 033117
(2006)]. In the present paper we study and explain phenomenologically a
connection between dynamical, topological, and statistical properties of
chaotic mixing and transport in the model flow in terms of dynamical traps,
singular zones in the phase space where particles may spend arbitrary long but
finite time [Zaslavsky, Phys. D {\bf 168--169}, 292 (2002)]. The transport of
passive particles is described in terms of lengths and durations of zonal
flights which are events between two successive changes of sign of zonal
velocity. Some peculiarities of the respective probability density functions
for short flights are proven to be caused by the so-called rotational-islands
traps connected with the boundaries of resonant islands (including those of the
vortex cores) filled with the particles moving in the same frame. Whereas, the
statistics of long flights can be explained by the influence of the so-called
ballistic-islands traps filled with the particles moving from a frame to frame.
"
0,201,"  In his paper the heating of the fullerenes by ultra-short laser pulses is
investigated. The thermal Heaviside equation is formulated and solved for the
Cauchy initial condition The effective thermal relaxation time is calculated..
  Key words: fullerenes, Heaviside thermal equation, effective thermal
relaxation time.
"
0,202,"  We study the quantum properties of Rydberg atoms in a magnetic
Ioffe-Pritchard trap which is superimposed by a homogeneous electric field.
Trapped Rydberg atoms can be created in long-lived electronic states exhibiting
a permanent electric dipole moment of several hundred Debye. The resulting
dipole-dipole interaction in conjunction with the radial confinement is
demonstrated to give rise to an effectively one-dimensional ultracold Rydberg
gas with a macroscopic interparticle distance. We derive analytical expressions
for the electric dipole moment and the critical linear density of Rydberg
atoms.
"
0,203,"  We calculate the sensitivity of the inversion spectrum of ammonia to possible
time-variation of the ratio of the proton mass to the electron mass,
mu=m_p/m_e. For the inversion transition (lambda= 1.25 cm^{-1}) the relative
frequency shift is significantly enhanced: delta(omega)/omega=-4.46,
delta(mu)/mu. This enhancement allows one to increase sensitivity to the
time-variation of mu using NH_3 spectra for high redshift objects. We use
published data on microwave spectra of the object B0218+357 to place the limit
delta(mu)/mu =(0.6 +/- 1.9) 10^{-6} at redshift z=0.6847; this limit is several
times better than the limits obtained by different methods and may be
significantly improved. Assuming linear time dependence we obtain
dot{mu}/mu=(-1 +/- 3) 10^{-16} yr^{-1}.
"
0,204,"  The bandstructure was calculated by the full-potential linearized augmented
plane wave method. The result reveals two important insights to the novel
second harmonic generation (SHG) of alpha-phase lithium iodate
($\alpha-LiIO_{3}$) crystal: the existence of finite intra-band momentum matrix
elements due to the non-inversion symmetry of the crystal illuminating the
potential of the intra-band transition, and the strong covalent bonding between
the $I$-atoms and the ligand $O$-atoms resulting the condition of the
double-resonance. An inter-band transition scenario in SHG as $\alpha-LiIO_{3}$
in nano-structure is proposed. The optical properties were calculated within
the theoretical framework of the time-dependent perturbation of the
independent-particle model. The dielectric tensors and the refractive index
were evaluated. Comparisons between the predictions and the results were made:
the x-ray near edge absorption spectra; the refractive index at the static
limit, and at finite frequencies. Possible factors attributing the calculation
errors is discussed.
"
0,205,"  We consider a social system of interacting heterogeneous agents with learning
abilities, a model close to Random Field Ising Models, where the random field
corresponds to the idiosyncratic willingness to pay. Given a fixed price,
agents decide repeatedly whether to buy or not a unit of a good, so as to
maximize their expected utilities. We show that the equilibrium reached by the
system depends on the nature of the information agents use to estimate their
expected utilities.
"
0,206,"  We consider a model of socially interacting individuals that make a binary
choice in a context of positive additive endogenous externalities. It
encompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics
literature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of
idiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay
(IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves
that include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non
constant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the
standard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand
is a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if
the IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which
the inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption
rates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price
there are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we
exhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the
system presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These
properties are shown to depend only on qualitative features of the IWP
distribution: modality (number of maxima), smoothness and type of support
(compact or infinite). The main results are summarized as phase diagrams in the
space of the model parameters, on which the regions of multiple equilibria are
precisely delimited.
"
0,207,"  We show in spatially one dimensional Madelung fluid that a simple requirement
on local stability of the maximum of quantum probability density will, if
combined with the global scale invariance of quantum potential, lead to a class
of quantum probability densities globally being self-trapped by their own
self-generated quantum potentials, possessing only a finite-size spatial
support. It turns out to belong to a class of the most probable wave function
given its energy through the maximum entropy principle. We proceed to show that
there is a limiting case in which the quantum probability density becomes the
stationary-moving soliton-like solution of the Schr\""odinger equation.
"
0,208,"  We use optical tweezers to perform stretching experiments on DNA molecules
when interacting with the drugs daunomycin and ethidium bromide, which
intercalate the DNA molecule. These experiments are performed in the low-force
regime from zero up to 2 pN. Our results show that the persistence length of
the DNA-drug complexes increases strongly as the drug concentration increases
up to some critical value. Above this critical value, the persistence length
decreases abruptly and remains practically constant for larger drug
concentrations. The contour length of the molecules increases monotonically and
saturates as drugs concentration increases. Measured in- tercalants critical
concentrations for the persistence length transition coincide with reported
values for the helix-coil transition of DNA-drug complexes, obtained from
sedimentation experiments.
"
0,209,"  In this work, we study the size of the particles involved in a powder snow
avalanche phenomenon. To determine these sizes, we study all the phenomena the
particles have to face before arriving in the ""body"" of the avalanche. We study
the boundary layer which is at the bottom of the avalanche. We determine, with
the help of experimental data, the range of size of the particles that can be
entrained by the avalanche. We then examine the possibility for these particles
to reach the top of the boundary layer, and so to take part in the avalanche.
Our final result is that the more frequent particles suspended in a powder snow
avalanche have a size lower than 200 micrometers.
"
0,210,"  In this work, we consider several types of lubricants - including
non-Newtonian fluids - that were studied under various operating conditions
leading us to explore a wide range of dimensionless parameters. The
experimental results are compared with predictions given by the usual
analytical EHL relationships and by more recently developed models. This broad
comparison conducted with particular emphasis on minimum film thickness (hm)
showed a fair agreement between experimental data and a few predictions
including some obtained from extended models. Commonly used elasto-hydrodynamic
lubrication (EHL) models did not systematically gave accurate hm estimation,
whereas minimum film thickness not only is a yield value but also serves as a
key parameter in estimating lubrication regimes.
"
0,211,"  Yield design formulation for porous media subjected to flow, using
approximate pressure field. We attempt here to use the kinematic method of
yield design in the case of a porous medium subjected to flow (with or without
free surface), without looking for the exact solution of the pressure field.
The method proposed here is based on the use of approximate pressure fields. In
this paper, we show how, under different conditions concerning the yield
criterion and the velocity field, the use of such approximate fields allows to
obtain a necessary condition for stability without having to find the real
pressure field. Nous cherchons ici \`a utiliser la m\'ethode cin\'ematique du

0,212,"  An analogy between electromagnetism and acoustics is presented in 2D. The

"
0,213,"  Linear thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and specific heat of Ti bulk is

0,214,"  Based only on the information gathered in a snapshot of a directed network,
we present a formal way of checking if the proposed model is correct for the

"
0,216,"  Solid state lasers are demanding independent control in the gain media and
cavity loss to achieve ultra short laser pulses using passive mode-locking.
Recently, laser mode-locking is achieved with a MBE structure with multiple
quantum wells, designed to achieve two functions; Bragg mirror and changes in
absorption to control the cavity dynamics. The use of an AlGaAs/AlAs Bragg
mirror with a 15 nm GaAs saturable absorber used in a Cr:LiSAF tuneable laser
proved to be effective to produce femtosecond pulses. The use of saturable
absorbers thus far is a trial and error procedure that is changing due to the
correlation with more predictive procedures.
"
0,217,"  Prominent ethical and policy issues such as affirmative action and female
enrollment in science and engineering revolve around the idea that diversity is
good. However, even though diversity is an ambiguous concept, a precise
definition is seldom provided. We show that diversity may be construed as a
factual description, a craving for symmetry, an intrinsic good, an instrumental
good, a symptom, or a side effect. These acceptions differ vastly in their
nature and properties. The first one cannot lead to any action and the second
one is mistaken. Diversity as intrinsic good is a mere opinion, which cannot be
concretely applied; moreover, the most commonly invoked forms of diversity
(sexual and racial) are not intrinsically good. On the other hand, diversity as
instrumental good can be evaluated empirically and can give rise to policies,
but these may be very weak. Finally, symptoms and side effects are not actually
about diversity. We consider the example of female enrollment in science and
engineering, interpreting the various arguments found in the literature in
light of this polysemy.
  Keywords: ethics, policy, higher education, female students, minority
students, affirmative action
"
0,218,"  The widely used large-scale diagonalization method using harmonic oscillator
basis functions (an instance of the Rayleigh-Ritz method, also called a
spectral method, configuration-interaction method, or ``exact diagonalization''
method) is systematically analyzed using results for the convergence of Hermite
function series. We apply this theory to a Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional
model of a quantum dot. The method is shown to converge slowly, and the
non-smooth character of the interaction potential is identified as the main
problem with the chosen basis, while on the other hand its important advantages
are pointed out. An effective interaction obtained by a similarity
transformation is proposed for improving the convergence of the diagonalization
scheme, and numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the improvement.
Generalizations to more particles and dimensions are discussed.
"
0,219,"  We present a simple quantum mechanical model to describe Coulomb explosion of
H$_2^+$ by short, intense, infrared laser pulses. The model is based on the
length gauge version of the molecular strong-field approximation and is valid
for pulses shorter than 50 fs where the process of dissociation prior to
ionization is negligible. The results are compared with recent experimental
results for the proton energy spectrum [I. Ben-Itzhak et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
95, 073002 (2005), B. D. Esry et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 013003 (2006)]. The
predictions of the model reproduce the profile of the spectrum although the
peak energy is slightly lower than the observations. For comparison, we also
present results obtained by two different tunneling models for this process.
"
0,220,"  Mammoths lived in Arctic East Siberia. In this region there is not sufficient
sunlight over the year for the growth of the plants on which these animals
feed. Therefore the latitude of this region was lower before the end of the
Pleistocene. As the cause of this geographic pole shift, we postulate a massive
object, which moved in an extremely eccentric orbit and was hot from tidal work
and solar radiation. Evaporation produced a disk-shaped cloud of ions around
the Sun. This cloud partially shielded the solar radiation, producing the cold
and warm periods that characterize the Pleistocene. The shielding depends on
the inclination of Earth's orbit, which has a period of 100'000 years. The
cloud builds up to a density at which inelastic particle collisions induce its
collapse The resulting near-periodic time dependence resembles that of
Dansgaard-Oeschger events. During cold periods fine grained inclusions were
deposited into the ice. The Pleistocene ended when the massive object had a
close encounter with the Earth, which suffered a one per mil stretching
deformation. While the deformation relaxed to an equilibrium shape in one to
several years, the globe turned relative to the rotation axis: The North Pole
moved from Greenland to the Arctic Sea. The massive object was torn to pieces,
which evaporated.
"
0,221,"  The present work performs full bandstructure calculations to investigate the
structural effect and the transition mechanisms of the second harmonic
generation (SHG) susceptibility of the $\alpha-LiIO_{3}$ crystal. The anomalous
inconsistency of associated experimental data of the SHG susceptibility tensor
is elucidated to be dominated by the structural effect especially on the
topology of $O$-atoms. On the manipulation of the structural effect, the
modification of SHG susceptibility using an external pressure is simulated. The
calculations of SHG susceptibility tensor are completed at finite frequencies
and the static limit. The comparison with the experiments is also incorporated.
On the analysis of the transition mechanisms, the inter-band transition is
determined to entirely dominate the whole SHG susceptibility at the static
limit; however, the effect of the intra-band motion is revealed to be as
important as that of the inter-band transition at finite frequencies.
"
0,222,"  The following question is addressed: under what conditions can a strange
diffusive process, defined by a semi-dynamical V-Langevin equation or its
associated Hybrid kinetic equation (HKE), be described by an equivalent purely
stochastic process, defined by a Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) or by a
Fractional Differential Equation (FDE)? More specifically, does there exist a
class of V-Langevin equations with long-range (algebraic) velocity temporal
correlation, that leads to a time-fractional superdiffusive process? The answer
is always affirmative in one dimension. It is always negative in two
dimensions: any algebraically decaying temporal velocity correlation (with a
Gaussian spatial correlation) produces a normal diffusive process. General
conditions relating the diffusive nature of the process to the temporal
exponent of the Lagrangian velocity correlation (in Corrsin approximation) are
derived.
"
0,223,"  We study the energy deposition by light and heavy nuclei in tissue-like media
as used for cancer therapy. The depth-dose distributions for protons, $^{3}$He,
$^{12}$C, $^{20}$Ne, and $^{58}$Ni nuclei are calculated within a Monte Carlo
model based on the GEANT4 toolkit. These distributions are compared with each
other and with available experimental data. It is demonstrated that nuclear
fragmentation reactions essentially reduce the peak-to-plateau ratio of the
dose profiles for deeply penetrating energetic ions heavier than $^{3}$He. On
the other hand, all projectiles up to $^{20}$Ne were found equally suitable for
therapeutic use at low penetration depths.
"
0,224,"  Is it possible to link a set of nodes without using preexisting positional
information or any kind of long-range attraction of the nodes? Can the process
of generating positional information, i.e. the detection of ``unknown'' nodes
and the estabishment of chemical gradients, \emph{and} the process of network
formation, i.e. the establishment of links between nodes, occur in parallel, on
a comparable time scale, as a process of co-evolution?
  The paper discusses a model where the generation of relevant information for
establishing the links between nodes results from the interaction of many
\emph{agents}, i.e. subunits of the system that are capable of performing some
activities. Their collective interaction is based on (indirect) communication,
which also includes memory effects and the dissemination of information in the
system. The relevant (``pragmatic'') information that leads to the
establishment of the links then emerges from an evolutionary interplay of
selection and reamplification.
"
0,225,"  This article discusses the techniques used to select online promising events
at high energy and high luminosity colliders. After a brief introduction,
explaining some general aspects of triggering, the more specific implementation
options for well established machines like the Tevatron and Large Hadron
Collider are presented. An outlook on what difficulties need to be met is given
when designing trigger systems at the Super Large Hadron Collider, or at the
International Linear Collider
"
0,226,"  It is proposed to apply a recently developed concept of local wave velocities
to the dynamical field characteristics, especially for the canonical field
energy density. It is shown that local energy velocities can be derived from
the lagrangian directly. The local velocities of zero- and first- order for
energy propagation has been obtained for special cases of scalar and vector
fields. Some important special cases of these results are discussed.
"
0,227,"  We report on the observation of enhanced microwave transmission through
quasi-periodic hole arrays in metal films. The fraction of transmitted light
reaches 50% in a self-standing metal film and approaches 90% when the film is
sandwiched between thin dielectric slabs, while the holes occupy only 10% of
the sample area. The maximum transmission is accompanied by zero phase change,
rendering the film almost 'invisible' over a wide frequency range. The
extraordinary transmission phenomenon is interpreted in terms of resonances in
the self-consistent interaction between holes, which are represented by
effective electric and magnetic dipoles.
"
0,228,"  We study the flow response to an externally imposed homogeneous magnetic
field in a turbulent swirling flow of liquid sodium -- the VKS2 experiment in
which magnetic Reynolds numbers Rm up to 50 are reached. Induction effects are
larger than in the former VKS1 experiment. At Rm larger than about 25, the
local amplitude of induced field components supersedes that of the applied
field, and exhibits non-Gaussian fluctuations. Slow dynamical instationarities
and low-frequency bimodal dynamics are observed in the induction, presumably
tracing back to large scale fluctuations in the hydrodynamic flow.
"
0,229,"  Author offers and researches a new, cheap method for the extraction of
freshwater from the Earth atmosphere. The suggected method is fundamentally
dictinct from all existing methods that extract freshwater from air. All other
industrial methods extract water from a saline water source (in most cases from
seawater). This new method may be used at any point in the Earth except Polar
Zones. It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater
is not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is
very environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the
first variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube
in a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in
the second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface.
In the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air
flow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.
  The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount.
Moreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.)
and can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way
the freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is
injected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heater
produces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generation
plant. The offered electricity installation in 100 - 200 times cheaper than any
common electric plant of equivalent output.
  Key words: Extraction freshwater, method of getting freshwater, receiving
energy from atmosphere, powerful renewal electric plant.
"
0,230,"  CLIC is a linear $e^+e^-$ ($\gamma\gamma$) collider project which uses a
drive beam to accelerate the main beam. The drive beam provides RF power for
each corresponding unit of the main linac through energy extracting RF
structures. CLIC has a wide range of center-of-mass energy options from 150 GeV
to 3 TeV. The present paper contains optimization of Free Electron Laser (FEL)
using one bunch of CLIC drive beam in order to provide polarized light
amplification using appropriate wiggler and luminosity spectrum of
$\gamma\gamma$ collider for $E_{cm}$=0.5 TeV. Then amplified laser can be
converted to a polarized high-energy $\gamma$ beam at the Conversion point
(CP-prior to electron positron interaction point) in the process of Compton
backscattering. At the CP a powerful laser pulse (FEL) focused to main linac
electrons (positrons). Here this scheme described and it is show that CLIC
drive beam parameters satisfy the requirement of FEL additionally essential
undulator parameters has been defined. Achievable $\gamma\gamma$ luminosity is
above $10^{34}$.
"
0,231,"  We present an analytic theory of the diffraction of (matter) waves by a
lattice in the ""quasi-Bragg"" regime, by which we mean the transition region
between the long-interaction Bragg and ""channelling"" regimes and the
short-interaction Raman-Nath regime. The Schroedinger equation is solved by
adiabatic expansion, using the conventional adiabatic approximation as a
starting point, and re-inserting the result into the Schroedinger equation to
yield a second order correction. Closed expressions for arbitrary pulse shapes
and diffraction orders are obtained and the losses of the population to output
states otherwise forbidden by the Bragg condition are derived. We consider the
phase shift due to couplings of the desired output to these states that depends
on the interaction strength and duration and show how these can be kept
negligible by a choice of smooth (e.g., Gaussian) envelope functions even in
situations that substantially violate the adiabaticity condition. We also give
an efficient method for calculating the effective Rabi frequency (which is
related to the eigenvalues of Mathieu functions) in the quasi-Bragg regime.
"
0,232,"  In this paper the motion of quantum particles with initial mass m is
investigated. The quantum mechanics equation is formulated and solved. It is
shown that the wave function contains the component which is depended on the
gravitation fine structure constant
"
0,233,"  The structural properties of L-alanine amino acid in aqueous solution and in
crystalline phase have been studied by means of density-functional
electronic-structure and molecular dynamics simulations. The solvated
zwitterionic structure of L-alanine (+NH3-C2H4-COO-) was systematically
compared to the structure of its zwitterionic crystalline analogue acquired
from both computer simulations and experiments. It turns out that the
structural properties of an alanine molecule in aqueous solution can differ
significantly from those in crystalline phase, these differences being mainly
attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions. In particular, we found that the
largest difference between the two alanine forms can be seen for the
orientation and bond lengths of the carboxylate (COO-) group: in aqueous
solution the C-O bond lengths appear to strongly correlate with the number of
water molecules which form hydrogen bonds with the COO- group. Furthermore, the
hydrogen bond lengths are shorter and the hydrogen bond angles are larger for
L-alanine in water as compared to crystal. Overall, our findings strongly
suggest that the generally accepted approach of extending the structural
information acquired from crystallographic data to a L-alanine molecule in
aqueous solution should be used with caution.
"
0,234,"  We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that
the frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power-law with
an exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled
distribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent.
We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed
playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar
nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical
fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular
generating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with
composite decisions.
"
0,235,"  A computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the identification of pulmonary
nodules in low-dose multi-detector helical Computed Tomography (CT) images was
developed in the framework of the MAGIC-5 Italian project. One of the main
goals of this project is to build a distributed database of lung CT scans in
order to enable automated image analysis through a data and cpu GRID
infrastructure. The basic modules of our lung-CAD system, a dot-enhancement
filter for nodule candidate selection and a neural classifier for
false-positive finding reduction, are described. The system was designed and
tested for both internal and sub-pleural nodules. The results obtained on the
collected database of low-dose thin-slice CT scans are shown in terms of free
response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curves and discussed.
"
0,236,"  The nature of non-exponential kinetics in microbial cells inactivation by
pulsed electric fields (PEF) is discussed. It was demonstrated that possible
mechanism of non-exponential kinetics can be related to orientational disorder
in suspension of microbial cells of anisotropic form. A numerical studies of
spheroidal cell suspensions was carried out. The most pronounced deviations
from the exponential kinetics were observed for disordered suspensions of
prolate spheroids at small electric field strength $E$ or at large aspect ratio
$a$. For partially oriented suspensions, efficiency of inactivation enhances
with increasing of order parameter and field strength. A possibility of the
PEF-induced orientational ordering in microbial suspensions is discussed.
"
0,237,"  We propose a criterion for identifying the orientation of the X-line when two
regions of plasma with arbitrary densities, temperatures, and magnetic fields
undergo reconnection. The X-line points in the direction that maximizes the
(suitably-defined) Alfv\'en speed characterizing the reconnection outflow. For
many situations a good approximation is that the X-line bisects the angle
formed by the magnetic fields.
"
0,238,"  Unconstrained CO2 emission from fossil fuel burning has been the dominant
cause of observed anthropogenic global warming. The amounts of ""proven"" and
potential fossil fuel reserves are uncertain and debated. Regardless of the
true values, society has flexibility in the degree to which it chooses to
exploit these reserves, especially unconventional fossil fuels and those
located in extreme or pristine environments. If conventional oil production
peaks within the next few decades, it may have a large effect on future
atmospheric CO2 and climate change, depending upon subsequent energy choices.
Assuming that proven oil and gas reserves do not greatly exceed estimates of
the Energy Information Administration, and recent trends are toward lower
estimates, we show that it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO2 from exceeding
about 450 ppm by 2100, provided that emissions from coal, unconventional fossil
fuels, and land use are constrained. Coal-fired power plants without
sequestration must be phased out before mid-century to achieve this CO2 limit.
It is also important to ""stretch"" conventional oil reserves via energy
conservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid
fuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are
being developed for the era ""beyond fossil fuels"". We argue that a rising price
on carbon emissions is needed to discourage conversion of the vast fossil
resources into usable reserves, and to keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.
"
0,239,"  Erwin Schrodinger (1939) proved that quantum wave functions coevolve with the
curved spacetime of the Friedmann universe. Schrodinger's derivation explains
the Hubble redshift of photons in an expanding universe, the energy changes of
moving particles, and establishes the coevolution of atoms and other quantum
systems with spacetime geometry. The assumption often made that small quantum
systems are isolated and that their properties remain constant as the Friedmann
universe evolves is incompatible with relativistic quantum mechanics and with
general relativity.
"
0,240,"  By considering the structure of holococcoliths (calcite plates that cover
holococcolithophores, a haploid phase of the coccolithophore life cycle) as a
photonic structure, we apply a discrete dipolar approximation to study the
light backscattering properties of these algae. We show that some holococcolith
structures have the ability to scatter the ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This
property may represent an advantage for holococcolithophores possessing it, by
allowing them to live higher in the water column than other coccolithophores.
"
0,241,"  How do blogs cite and influence each other? How do such links evolve? Does
the popularity of old blog posts drop exponentially with time? These are some
of the questions that we address in this work. Our goal is to build a model
that generates realistic cascades, so that it can help us with link prediction
and outlier detection.
  Blogs (weblogs) have become an important medium of information because of
their timely publication, ease of use, and wide availability. In fact, they
often make headlines, by discussing and discovering evidence about political
events and facts. Often blogs link to one another, creating a publicly
available record of how information and influence spreads through an underlying
social network. Aggregating links from several blog posts creates a directed
graph which we analyze to discover the patterns of information propagation in
blogspace, and thereby understand the underlying social network. Not only are
blogs interesting on their own merit, but our analysis also sheds light on how
rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer networks.
  Here we report some surprising findings of the blog linking and information
propagation structure, after we analyzed one of the largest available datasets,
with 45,000 blogs and ~ 2.2 million blog-postings. Our analysis also sheds
light on how rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer
networks. We also present a simple model that mimics the spread of information
on the blogosphere, and produces information cascades very similar to those
found in real life.

0,242,"  Comments on six papers published by S.P. Anjali Devi and R. Kandasamy in Heat
and Mass Transfer, ZAMM, Mechanics Research Communications, International
Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer, Communications in Numerical Methods

  In conclusion all the above papers are of very low quality, written without

"
0,243,"  We present the most accurate up-to-date theoretical values of the
{2p_{1/2}}-{2s} and {2p_{3/2}}-{2s} transition energies and the ground-state
hyperfine splitting in ${\rm Sc}^{18+}$. All two- and three-electron
contributions to the energy values up to the two-photon level are treated in
the framework of bound-state QED without $\aZ$-expansion. The interelectronic
interaction beyond the two-photon level is taken into account by means of the
large-scale configuration-interaction Dirac-Fock-Sturm (CI-DFS) method. The
relativistic recoil correction is calculated with many-electron wave functions
in order to take into account the electron-correlation effect. The accuracy of
the transition energy values is improved by a factor of five compared to the
previous calculations. The CI-DFS calculation of interelectronic-interaction
effects and the evaluation of the QED correction in an effective screening
potential provide significant improvement for the $2s$ hyperfine splitting. The
results obtained are in a good agreement with recently published experimental
data.
"
0,244,"  Parametric instabilities driven by partially coherent radiation in plasmas
are described by a generalized statistical Wigner-Moyal set of equations,
formally equivalent to the full wave equation, coupled to the plasma fluid
equations. A generalized dispersion relation for Stimulated Raman Scattering
driven by a partially coherent pump field is derived, revealing a growth rate
dependence, with the coherence width $\sigma$ of the radiation field, scaling
with $1/\sigma$ for backscattering (three-wave process), and with
$1/\sigma^{1/2}$ for direct forward scattering (four-wave process). Our results
demonstrate the possibility to control the growth rates of these instabilities
by properly using broadband pump radiation fields.
"
0,245,"  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to a fatal error in the
analysis. The manuscript was submitted to Chemical Engineering Science. To
clarify the situation, we copy the main comment from an anonymous referee here:
""To my understanding, the authors analyze i = 1 ... 63 time series and
calculate their mean and standard deviation. These time series correspond to
individual, single ignition processes. Is this correct? If yes, these
processes, as Fig. 3 shows very clearly, are not stationary, and the pressure
difference (i.e., the signal) quickly decays to zero. In this case both the
mean and the standard deviation are poorly defined, for example because both
depend in a trivial fashion on the observation period T. I am not aware of any
study (including those cited by the authors) which allows for any conclusion
from such non-stationary signals. The results of Menezes and Barabasi are
strictly only valid for stationary time series, and they cannot be applied at
all in this case."" We agree with this insightful comment that our data are not
stationary and the method adopted in our manuscript does not apply. We do not
see any possibility to correct this error and decide to withdraw it. We would
like to thank gratefully the referee and apologize for any inconvenience caused
by our oversight.
"
0,246,"  The generator coordinate (GC) method is a variational approach to the quantum
many-body problem in which interacting many-body wave functions are constructed
as superpositions of (generally nonorthogonal) eigenstates of auxiliary
Hamiltonians containing a deformation parameter. This paper presents a
time-dependent extension of the GC method as a new approach to improve existing
approximations of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in time-dependent
density-functional theory (TDDFT). The time-dependent GC method is shown to be
a conceptually and computationally simple tool to build memory effects into any
existing adiabatic XC potential. As an illustration, the method is applied to
driven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic
potential (Hooke's atom). It is demonstrated that a proper choice of
time-dependent generator coordinates in conjunction with the adiabatic
local-density approximation reproduces the exact linear and nonlinear
two-electron dynamics quite accurately, including features associated with
double excitations that cannot be captured by TDDFT in the adiabatic
approximation.
"
0,247,"  It is not uncommon, e.g. in the media, that specific groups are categorized
as being racist. Based on an extensive dataset of intermarriage statistics our
study questions the legitimacy of such characterizations. It suggests that, far
from being group-dependent, segregation mechanisms are instead
situation-dependent. More precisely, the degree of integration of a minority in
terms of the frequency of intermarriage is seen to crucially depend upon the
the proportion p of the minority. Thus, a population may have a segregative
behavior with respect to a high-p (p>20%) minority A and at the same time a
tolerant attitude toward a low-p (p<2%) minority B. This remains true even when
A and B represent the same minority; for instance Black-White intermarriage is
much more frequent in Montana than it is in South Carolina. In short, the
nature of minority groups is largely irrelevant, the key factor being their
proportion in a given area.
"
0,248,"  Medvedev and Melott (2007) have suggested that periodicity in fossil
biodiversity may be induced by cosmic rays which vary as the Solar System
oscillates normal to the galactic disk. We re-examine the evidence for a 62
million year (Myr) periodicity in biodiversity throughout the Phanerozoic
history of animal life reported by Rohde & Mueller (2005), as well as related
questions of periodicity in origination and extinction. We find that the signal
is robust against variations in methods of analysis, and is based on
fluctuations in the Paleozoic and a substantial part of the Mesozoic.
Examination of origination and extinction is somewhat ambiguous, with results
depending upon procedure. Origination and extinction intensity as defined by RM
may be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphic
intervals. Nevertheless, when a procedure free of this artifact is implemented,
the 27 Myr periodicity appears in origination, suggesting that the artifact may
ultimately be based on a signal in the data. A 62 Myr feature appears in
extinction, when this same procedure is used. We conclude that evidence for a
periodicity at 62 Myr is robust, and evidence for periodicity at approximately
27 Myr is also present, albeit more ambiguous.
"
0,249,"  We report an experimental observation of polaritonic optical bistability of
the laser emission in a planar semiconductor microcavity with a $100\AA$ GaAs
single quantum well in the strong-coupling regime. The bistability curves show
crossings that indicate a competition between a Kerr-like effect induced by the
polariton population and thermal effects. Associated with the bistability,
laser-like emission occurs at the bare cavity mode.
"
0,250,"  The CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) experiment searches for axions from the
Sun converted into photons with energies up to around 10 keV via the inverse
Primakoff effect in the high magnetic field of a superconducting Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) prototype magnet. A backside illuminated pn-CCD detector in
conjunction with an X-ray mirror optics is one of the three detectors used in
CAST to register the expected photon signal. Since this signal is very rare and
different background components (environmental gamma radiation, cosmic rays,
intrinsic radioactive impurities in the set-up, ...) entangle it, a detailed
study of the detector background has been undertaken with the aim to understand
and further reduce the background level of the detector. The analysis is based
on measured data taken during the Phase I of CAST and on Monte Carlo
simulations of different background components. This study will show that the
observed background level (at a rate of (8.00+-0.07)10^-5 counts/cm^2/s/keV
between 1 and 7 keV) seems to be dominated by the external gamma background due
to usual activities at the experimental site, while radioactive impurities in
the detector itself and cosmic neutrons could make just smaller contribution.
"
0,251,"  We propose a geometric growth model for weighted scale-free networks, which
is controlled by two tunable parameters. We derive exactly the main
characteristics of the networks, which are partially determined by the
parameters. Analytical results indicate that the resulting networks have
power-law distributions of degree, strength, weight and betweenness, a
scale-free behavior for degree correlations, logarithmic small average path
length and diameter with network size. The obtained properties are in agreement
with empirical data observed in many real-life networks, which shows that the
presented model may provide valuable insight into the real systems.
"
0,252,"  In recent times there has been a surge of interest in seeking out patterns in
the aggregate behavior of socio-economic systems. One such domain is the
emergence of statistical regularities in the evolution of collective choice
from individual behavior. This is manifested in the sudden emergence of
popularity or ""success"" of certain ideas or products, compared to their
numerous, often very similar, competitors. In this paper, we present an
empirical study of a wide range of popularity distributions, spanning from
scientific paper citations to movie gross income. Our results show that in the
majority of cases, the distribution follows a log-normal form, suggesting that
multiplicative stochastic processes are the basis for emergence of popular
entities. This suggests the existence of some general principles of complex
organization leading to the emergence of popularity. We discuss the theoretical
principles needed to explain this socio-economic phenomenon, and present a
model for collective behavior that exhibits bimodality, which has been observed
in certain empirical popularity distributions.
"
0,253,"  Effective potentials of the relativistic m\alpha^6 order correction for the
ground state of the Coulomb two-center problem are calculated. They can be used
to evaluate the relativistic contribution of that order to the energies of
hydrogen molecular ions or metastable states of the antiprotonic helium atom,
where precision spectroscopic data are available. In our studies we use the
variational expansion based on randomly chosen exponents that permits to
achieve high numerical accuracy.
"
0,254,"  Density-functional theory requires ever better exchange-correlation (xc)
functionals for the ever more precise description of many-body effects on
electronic structure. Universal constraints on the xc energy are important
ingredients in the construction of improved functionals. Here we investigate
one such universal property of xc functionals: the Lieb-Oxford lower bound on
the exchange-correlation energy, $E_{xc}[n] \ge -C \int d^3r n^{4/3}$, where
$C\leq C_{LO}=1.68$. To this end, we perform a survey of available exact or
near-exact data on xc energies of atoms, ions, molecules, solids, and some
model Hamiltonians (the electron liquid, Hooke's atom and the Hubbard model).
All physically realistic density distributions investigated are consistent with
the tighter limit $C \leq 1$. For large classes of systems one can obtain
class-specific (but not fully universal) similar bounds. The Lieb-Oxford bound
with $C_{LO}=1.68$ is a key ingredient in the construction of modern xc
functionals, and a substantial change in the prefactor $C$ will have
consequences for the performance of these functionals.
"
0,255,"  This letter presents principles and applications of a virtual multi-channel
lock-in amplifier that is a simple but effective method to recover small ac
signal from noise with high presison. The fundamentals of this method are based
on calculation of cross-correlation function. Via this method, we successfully
built up a magnetoelectric measurement system which can perform precise and
versatile measurements without any analog lock-in amplifier. Using the virtual
multi-channel lock-in amplifier, the output of the magnetoelectric measurement
system is extensively rich in magnetoelectric coupling behaviors, including
coupling strength and phase lag, under various dc bias magnetic field and ac
magnetic field.
"
0,256,"  In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in
a sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to
the Dark Energy Problem, can be used to resolve the problem of the great
mismatch of numerical values between dark energy from cosmology and zero point
energy from quantum theory. It is shown that, if the zero point energies for
the cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is
not cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,
their separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical
difference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero
point value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two
zero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small
dark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to
interpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an
interpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are
discussed. In the first appendix to this paper, problems associated with the
standard model of cosmology are solved by redefining temperature in the dust
universe model. In the second appendix of this paper, an examination of the
dark matter problem in relation to a general relativistic generalisation of
Newton's inverse square law is undertaken. In the third appendix to this paper,
the formalism is used to derive a formula that gives a possible value for the
mass of the universe in terms of Newton's gravitation constant, Einstein's
Lambda and the velocity of light. All three appendices have their own detailed
abstracts.
"
0,257,"  The space-time geometry is considered to be a physical geometry, i.e. a
geometry described completely by the world function. All geometrical concepts
and geometric objects are taken from the proper Euclidean geometry. They are
expressed via the Euclidean world function \sigma_E and declared to be concepts
and objects of any physical geometry, provided the Euclidean world function
\sigma_E is replaced by the world function \sigma of the physical geometry in
question. The set of physical geometries is more powerful, than the set of
Riemannian geometries, and one needs to choose a true space-time geometry. In
general, the physical geometry is multivariant (there are many vectors which
are equivalent to a given vector, but are not equivalent between themselves).
The multivariance admits one to describe quantum effects as geometric effects
and to consider existence of elementary particles as a geometrical problem,
when the possibility of the physical existence of an elementary geometric
object in the form of a physical body is determined by the space-time geometry.
Multivariance admits one to describe discrete and continuous geometries, using
the same technique. A use of physical geometry admits one to realize the
geometrical approach to the quantum theory and to the theory of elementary
particles.
"
0,258,"  Experimental and theoretical studies are presented related to the
ground-state magneto-optical resonance prepared in Cesium vapour confined in an
Extremely Thin Cell (ETC, with thickness equal to the wavelength of the
irradiating light). It is shown that the utilization of the ETC allows one to
examine the formation of a magneto-optical resonance on the individual
hyperfine transitions, thus distinguishing processes resulting in dark (reduced
absorption) or bright (enhanced absorption) resonance formation. We report on
an experimental evidence of the bright magneto-optical resonance sign reversal
in Cs atoms confined in the ETC. A theoretical model is proposed based on the
optical Bloch equations that involves the elastic interaction processes of
atoms in the ETC with its walls resulting in depolarization of the Cs excited
state which is polarized by the exciting radiation. This depolarization leads
to the sign reversal of the bright resonance. Using the proposed model, the
magneto-optical resonance amplitude and width as a function of laser power are
calculated and compared with the experimental ones. The numerical results are
in good agreement with the experiment.
"
0,259,"  The pseudoparticle approach is a numerical technique to compute path
integrals without discretizing spacetime. The basic idea is to integrate over
those field configurations, which can be represented by a sum of a fixed number
of localized building blocks (pseudoparticles). In a couple of previous papers
we have successfully applied the pseudoparticle approach to pure SU(2)
Yang-Mills theory. In this work we discuss how to incorporate fermionic fields
in the pseudoparticle approach. To test our method, we compute the phase
diagram of the 1+1-dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the large-N limit.
"
0,260,"  We consider the stability of a porous medium submitted to a steady-state flow
with free-boundary. Assuming some hypotheses, it is possible to implement the
kinematic method by using an approximate pressure field bounding the true
pressure field from below. We are interested in finding such approximate
pressure fields and in proving that they bound the true pressure field from
below without knowing the true pressure field. We use fields which are
solutions of a problem with relaxed conditions with regard to the real problem.
Under a uniqueness condition of the solution of a weak formulation of the
problem, such fields are lower bounds for the true pressure field. Finally, we
give the example of a vertical dam.
"
0,261,"  A new algorithm has been developed to compute low Mach Numbers supercritical
fluid flows. The algorithm is applied using a finite volume method based on the
SIMPLER algorithm. Its main advantages are to decrease significantly the CPU
time, and the possibility for supercritical fluid flow modelisation to use
other discretisation methods (such as spectral methods and/or finite
differences) and other algorithms such as PISO or projection. It makes it
possible to solve 3D problems within reasonable CPU time even when considering
complex equations of state. The algorithm is given after first a brief
description of the previously existing algorithm to solve for supercritical
fluids. The side and bottom heated near critical carbon dioxide filled cavity
problems are respectively solved and compared to the previously obtained
results.
"
0,262,"  General relativity allows solutions exhibiting closed timelike curves. Time
travel generates paradoxes and quantum mechanics generalizations were proposed
to solve those paradoxes. The implications of self-consistent interactions on
acausal region of space-time are investigated. If the correspondence principle
is true, then all generalizations of quantum mechanics on acausal manifolds are
not renormalizable. Therefore quantum mechanics can only be defined on global
hyperbolic manifolds and all general relativity solutions exhibiting time
travel are unphysical.
"
0,263,"  In this paper we suggest a theoretical method based on the statistical
mechanics for treating the alpha-helix-random coil transition in alanine
polypeptides. We consider this process as a first-order phase transition and
develop a theory which is free of model parameters and is based solely on
fundamental physical principles. It describes essential thermodynamical
properties of the system such as heat capacity, the phase transition
temperature and others from the analysis of the polypeptide potential energy
surface calculated as a function of two dihedral angles, responsible for the
polypeptide twisting. The suggested theory is general and with some
modification can be applied for the description of phase transitions in other
complex molecular systems (e.g. proteins, DNA, nanotubes, atomic clusters,
fullerenes).
"
0,264,"  In the present paper we present results of calculations obtained with the use
of the theoretical method described in our preceding paper [1] and perform
detail analysis of alpha helix-random coil transition in alanine polypeptides
of different length. We have calculated the potential energy surfaces of
polypeptides with respect to their twisting degrees of freedom and construct a
parameter-free partition function of the polypeptide using the suggested method
[1]. From the build up partition function we derive various thermodynamical
characteristics for alanine polypeptides of different length as a function of
temperature. Thus, we analyze the temperature dependence of the heat capacity,
latent heat and helicity for alanine polypeptides consisting of 21, 30, 40, 50
and 100 amino acids. Alternatively, we have obtained same thermodynamical
characteristics from the use of molecular dynamics simulations and compared
them with the results of the new statistical mechanics approach. The comparison
proves the validity of the statistical mechanic approach and establishes its
accuracy.
"
0,265,"  We wish to transmit messages to and from a hypersonic vehicle around which a
plasma sheath has formed. For long distance transmission, the signal carrying
these messages must be necessarily low frequency, typically 2 GHz, to which the
plasma sheath is opaque. The idea is to use the plasma properties to make the
plasma sheath appear transparent.
"
0,266,"  The structure of the unnatural parity states of PsH, LiPs, NaPs and KPs are
investigated with the configuration interaction and stochastic variational
methods. The binding energies (in hartree) are found to be 8.17x10-4,
4.42x10-4, 15.14x10-4 and 21.80x10-4 respectively. These states are constructed
by first coupling the two electrons into a configuration which is predominantly
3Pe, and then adding a p-wave positron. All the active particles are in states
in which the relative angular momentum between any pair of particles is at
least L = 1. The LiPs state is Borromean since there are no 3-body bound
subsystems (of the correct symmetry) of the (Li+, e-, e-, e+) particles that
make up the system. The dominant decay mode of these states will be radiative
decay into a configuration that autoionizes or undergoes positron annihilation.
"
0,267,"  Surface based geometries of microfabricated wires or patterned magnetic films
can be used to magnetically trap and manipulate ultracold neutral atoms or
Bose-Einstein condensates. We investigate the magnetic properties of such atom
chips using a scanning magnetoresistive (MR) microscope with high spatial
resolution and high field sensitivity. We show that MR sensors are ideally
suited to observe small variations of the magnetic field caused by
imperfections in the wires or magnetic materials which ultimately lead to
fragmentation of ultracold atom clouds. Measurements are also provided for the
magnetic field produced by a thin current-carrying wire with small geometric
modulations along the edge. Comparisons of our measurements with a full numeric
calculation of the current flow in the wire and the subsequent magnetic field
show excellent agreement. Our results highlight the use of scanning MR
microscopy as a convenient and powerful technique for precisely characterizing
the magnetic fields produced near the surface of atom chips.
"
0,268,"  We investigate the detailed dynamics of multidimensional Hamiltonian systems
by studying the evolution of volume elements formed by unit deviation vectors
about their orbits. The behavior of these volumes is strongly influenced by the
regular or chaotic nature of the motion, the number of deviation vectors, their
linear (in)dependence and the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. The different
time evolution of these volumes can be used to identify rapidly and efficiently
the nature of the dynamics, leading to the introduction of quantities that
clearly distinguish between chaotic behavior and quasiperiodic motion on
$N$-dimensional tori. More specifically we introduce the Generalized Alignment
Index of order $k$ (GALI$_k$) as the volume of a generalized parallelepiped,
whose edges are $k$ initially linearly independent unit deviation vectors from
the studied orbit whose magnitude is normalized to unity at every time step.
The GALI$_k$ is a generalization of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI)
(GALI$_2$ $\propto$ SALI). However, GALI$_k$ provides significantly more
detailed information on the local dynamics, allows for a faster and clearer
distinction between order and chaos than SALI and works even in cases where the
SALI method is inconclusive.
"
0,269,"  We show that the van der Waals-like phase separation instability of a driven
granular gas at zero gravity, previously investigated in two-dimensional
settings, persists in three dimensions. We consider a monodisperse granular gas
driven by a thermal wall of a three-dimensional rectangular container at zero
gravity. The basic steady state of this system, as described by granular
hydrodynamic equations, involves a denser and colder layer of granulate located
at the wall opposite to the driving wall. When the inelastic energy loss is
sufficiently high, the driven granular gas exhibits, in some range of average
densities, negative compressibility in the directions parallel to the driving
wall. When the lateral dimensions of the container are sufficiently large, the
negative compressibility causes spontaneous symmetry breaking of the basic
steady state and a phase separation instability. Event-driven molecular
dynamics simulations confirm and complement our theoretical predictions.
"
0,270,"  We address the role of multiplicative stochastic processes in modeling the
occurrence of power-law city size distributions. As an explanation of the
result of Zipf's rank analysis, Simon's model is presented in a mathematically
elementary way, with a thorough discussion of the involved hypotheses. Emphasis
is put on the flexibility of the model, as to its possible extensions and the
relaxation of some strong assumptions. We point out some open problems
regarding the prediction of the detailed shape of Zipf's rank plots, which may
be tackled by means of such extensions.
"
0,271,"  We consider a stiff polymer chain in poor solvent and apply a force at one
end of the chain. We find that by varying the stiffness parameter, polymer
undergoes a transition from the globule state to the folded like state. The
conformation of folded state mimics the $\beta$-sheet as seen in titin
molecule. Using exact enumeration technique, we study the extension-force and
force-temperature diagrams of such a system. Force-temperature diagram shows
the re-entrance behaviour for flexible chain. However, for stiff chain this
re-entrance behaviour is absent and there is an enhancement in
$\theta$-temperature with the rise of stiffness. We further propose that the
internal information about the frozen structure of polymer can be read from the
distribution of end-to-end distance which shows saw-tooth like behaviour.
"
0,272,"  The onset of an ""eye-phase"" and its role during the DNA unzipping is studied
when a force is applied to the interior of the chain. The directionality of the
hydrogen bond introduced here shows oscillations in force-extension curve
similar to a ""saw-tooth"" kind of oscillations seen in the protein unfolding
experiments. The effects of intermediates (hairpins) and stacking energies on
the melting profile have also been discussed.
"
0,273,"  Relativistic self-consistent-field calculations of the radial hyperfine
integrals have been performed in the 4d-shell element ions. The comparison with
available experimental results gives an estimate of configuration interaction
effects in the hyperfine interaction in these ions. The results can also be
used to derive nuclear moments from laserspectroscopic measurements of
radioactive isotopes.

"
0,274,"  In the framework of the model inter-comparison study - Asia Phase II (MICS2),
where eight models are compared over East Asia, this paper studies the
influence of different parameterizations used in the aerosol module on the
aerosol concentrations of sulfate and nitrate in PM10. An intracomparison of
aerosol concentrations is done for March 2001 using different configurations of
the aerosol module of one of the model used for the intercomparison. Single
modifications of a reference setup for model configurations are performed and
compared to a reference case. These modifications concern the size
distribution, i.e. the number of sections, and physical processes, i.e.
coagulation, condensation/evaporation, cloud chemistry, heterogeneous reactions
and sea-salt emissions. Comparing monthly averaged concentrations at different
stations, the importance of each parameterization is first assessed. It is
found that sulfate concentrations are little sensitive to sea-salt emissions
and to whether condensation is computed dynamically or by assuming
thermodynamic equilibrium. Nitrate concentrations are little sensitive to cloud
chemistry. However, a very high sensitivity to heterogeneous reactions is
observed. Thereafter, the variability of the aerosol concentrations to the use
of different chemistry transport models (CTMs) and the variability to the use
of different parameterizations in the aerosol module are compared. For sulfate,
the variability to the use of different parameterizations in the aerosol module
is lower than the variability to the use of different CTMs. However, for
nitrate, for monthly averaged concentrations averaged over four stations, these
two variabilities have the same order of magnitude.
"
0,275,"  The unbinding process of a protein-ligand complex of major biological
interest was investigated by means of a computational approach at atomistic
classical mechanical level. An energy minimisation-based technique was used to
determine the dissociation paths of the system by probing only a relevant set
of generalized coordinates. The complex problem was reduced to a
low-dimensional scanning along a selected distance between the protein and the
ligand. Orientational coordinates of the escaping fragment (the ligand) were
also assessed in order to further characterise the unbinding. Solvent effects
were accounted for by means of the Poisson--Boltzmann continuum model. The
corresponding dissociation time was derived from the calculated barrier height,
in compliance with the experimentally reported Arrhenius-like behaviour. The
computed results are in good agreement with the available experimental data.
"
0,276,"  Recently, the collisionless expansion of spherical nanoplasmas has been
analyzed with a new ergodic model, clarifying the transition from
hydrodynamic-like to Coulomb-explosion regimes, and providing accurate laws for
the relevant features of the phenomenon. A complete derivation of the model is
here presented. The important issue of the self-consistent initial conditions
is addressed by analyzing the initial charging transient due to the electron
expansion, in the approximation of immobile ions. A comparison among different
kinetic models for the expansion is presented, showing that the ergodic model
provides a simplified description, which retains the essential information on
the electron distribution, in particular, the energy spectrum. Results are
presented for a wide range of initial conditions (determined from a single
dimensionless parameter), in excellent agreement with calculations from the
exact Vlasov-Poisson theory, thus providing a complete and detailed
characterization of all the stages of the expansion.
"
0,277,"  A general {\it ab-initio} and non-perturbative method to solve the
time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation (TDSE) for the interaction of a strong
attosecond laser pulse with a general atom, i.e., beyond the models of
quasi-one-electron or quasi-two-electron targets, is described. The field-free
Hamiltonian and the dipole matrices are generated using a flexible $B$-spline
$R$-matrix method. This numerical implementation enables us to construct
term-dependent, non-orthogonal sets of one-electron orbitals for the bound and
continuum electrons. The solution of the TDSE is propagated in time using the
Arnoldi-Lanczos method, which does not require the diagonalization of any large
matrices. The method is illustrated by an application to the multi-photon
excitation and ionization of Ne atoms. Good agreement with $R$-matrix Floquet
calculations for the generalized cross sections for two-photon ionization is
achieved.
"
0,278,"  A specific, genuinely three-dimensional mechanism of rogue wave formation, in
a late stage of the modulational instability of a perturbed Stokes deep-water
wave, is recognized through numerical experiments. The simulations are based on
fully nonlinear equations describing weakly three-dimensional potential flows
of an ideal fluid with a free surface in terms of conformal variables.
Spontaneous formation of zigzag patterns for wave amplitude is observed in a
nonlinear stage of the instability. If initial wave steepness is sufficiently
high ($ka>0.06$), these coherent structures produce rogue waves. The most tall
waves appear in ``turns'' of the zigzags. For $ka<0.06$, the structures decay
typically without formation of steep waves.
"
0,279,"  In this study, three empirical Free Core Nutation (FCN) models developed to
the present time, MHB2000, Malkin's and Lambert's ones, are compared on the
basis of representation of variations of the FCN amplitude and phase predicted
by these models. It is possible to conclude, that the model of the author
provides the most realistic representation of the FCN variations. However, the
specified models are based on representation about single FCN rotational mode.
At the same time, some results of processing of the VLBI observations made
during last years, specify possible presence of two close FCN periods. A
theoretical explanation to presence of a second FCN frequency FCN has been
given by G. Krasinsky in his theory of rotation of the Earth with two-layer
liquid core, ERA2005. In the present work, for more detailed studying this
phenomenon, the IVS time series of celestial pole offset, and also those
predicted by the ERA2005 theory, have been investigated by means of several
statistical methods which confidently show presence of two fluctuations in
nutational movement of an Earth's rotation axis with the periods about -452 and
-410 solar days.
"
0,280,"  Forward time step integrators are splitting algorithms with only positive
splitting coefficients. When used in solving physical evolution equations,
these positive coefficients correspond to positive time steps. Forward
algorithms are essential for solving time-irreversible equations that cannot be
evolved using backward time steps. However, forward integrators are also better
in solving time-reversible equations of classical dynamics by tracking as
closely as possible the physical trajectory. This work compares in detail
various forward and non-forward fourth-order integrators using three, fourth,
five and six force evaluations. In the case of solving the 2D Kepler orbit, all
non-forward integrators are optimized by simply minimizing the size of their
backward time steps.
"
0,281,"  Some arguments in favour of the existence of tachyons and extensions of the
Lorentz Group are presented. On the former, it is observed that with a slight
modification to standard electromagnetic theory a single superluminal charge
will bind to itself in a self-sustaining circular orbit, suggestive of a
(modified) electromagnetic interpretation of the strong force. Symmetries in
that theory are used in the subsequent analysis as a starting point in the
search for physically-motivated extensions of the Lorentz Group. There is some
discussion of the validity of imaginary coordinates in superluminal
transformations of frame. The article concludes with some speculation on the
implications for faster-than light travel.
"
0,282,"  This paper follows in the tradition of direct-action versions of
electromagnetism having the aim of avoiding a balance of infinities wherein a
mechanical mass offsets an infinite electromagnetic mass so as to arrive at a
finite observed value. Given that, in this respect the direct-action approached
ultimately failed because its initial exclusion of self-action was found to be
untenable in the relativistic domain, this paper continues the tradition
considering instead a version of electromagnetism wherein mechanical action is
excluded and self-action is retained. It is shown that the resulting theory is
effectively interacting due to the presence of infinite forces. A vehicle for
the investigation is a pair of classical point charges in a positronium-like
arrangement for which the orbits are found to be self-sustaining and naturally
quantized.
"
0,283,"  The present paper aims at introducing the innovative technologies, based on
the concept of ""sensory substitution"" or ""perceptual supplementation"", we are
developing in the fields of human disability and biomedical engineering.
Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate practical assistive
biomedical and/technical devices and/or rehabilitating procedures for persons
with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback systems.
Proposed applications are dealing with: (1) pressure sores prevention in case
of spinal cord injuries (persons with paraplegia, or tetraplegia); (2) ankle
proprioceptive acuity improvement for driving assistance in older and/or
disabled adults; and (3) balance control improvement to prevent fall in older
and/or disabled adults. This paper presents results of three feasibility
studies performed on young healthy adults.
"
0,284,"  We analyze a large-scale snapshot of del.icio.us and investigate how the
number of different tags in the system grows as a function of a suitably
defined notion of time. We study the temporal evolution of the global
vocabulary size, i.e. the number of distinct tags in the entire system, as well
as the evolution of local vocabularies, that is the growth of the number of
distinct tags used in the context of a given resource or user. In both cases,
we find power-law behaviors with exponents smaller than one. Surprisingly, the
observed growth behaviors are remarkably regular throughout the entire history
of the system and across very different resources being bookmarked. Similar
sub-linear laws of growth have been observed in written text, and this
qualitative universality calls for an explanation and points in the direction
of non-trivial cognitive processes in the complex interaction patterns
characterizing collaborative tagging.
"
0,285,"  ALPHA is an international project that has recently begun experimentation at
CERN's Antiproton Decelerator (AD) facility. The primary goal of ALPHA is
stable trapping of cold antihydrogen atoms with the ultimate goal of precise
spectroscopic comparisons with hydrogen. We discuss the status of the ALPHA
project and the prospects for antihydrogen trapping.
"
0,286,"  This paper introduces the concept of symbolic sensor as an extension of the
smart sensor one. Then, the links between the physical world and the symbolic
one are introduced. The creation of symbols is proposed within the frame of the
pretopology theory. In order to adapt the sensor to the measurement context, a
learning process has been used to provide an adaptive interpretation of the
measurement. Finally, an example is presented in the case of a temperature
measurement.
"
0,287,"  Several theories for weakly damped free-surface flows have been formulated.
In this paper we use the linear approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations to
derive a new set of equations for potential flow which include dissipation due
to viscosity. A viscous correction is added not only to the irrotational
pressure (Bernoulli's equation), but also to the kinematic boundary condition.
The nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation that one can derive from the new set
of equations to describe the modulations of weakly nonlinear, weakly damped
deep-water gravity waves turns out to be the classical damped version of the
NLS equation that has been used by many authors without rigorous justification.
"
0,288,"  This paper deals with sensors which compute and report linguistic assessments
of their values.Such sensors, called symbolic sensors are a natural extension
of smart ones when working with control systems which use artificial
intelligence based technics. After having recalled the smart sensor concepts,
this paper introduces the symbolic sensor ones. Links between the physical
world and the symbolic one are described. It is then shown how Zadeh's
approximate reasoning theory provides a smart way to implement symbolic
sensors. Finally, since the symbolic sensor is a general component, a
functional adaptation to the measurement context is proposed.
"
0,289,"  Pressure ulcers are recognized as a major health issue in individuals with
spinal cord injuries and new approaches to prevent this pathology are
necessary. An innovative health strategy is being developed through the use of
computer and sensory substitution via the tongue in order to compensate for the
sensory loss in the buttock area for individuals with paraplegia. This sensory
compensation will enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to be aware of a
localized excess of pressure at the skin/seat interface and, consequently, will
enable them to prevent the formation of pressure ulcers by relieving the
cutaneous area of suffering. This work reports an initial evaluation of this
approach and the feasibility of creating an adapted behavior, with a change in
pressure as a response to electro-stimulated information on the tongue.
Obtained during a clinical study in 10 healthy seated subjects, the first
results are encouraging, with 92% success in 100 performed tests. These
results, which have to be completed and validated in the paraplegic population,
may lead to a new approach to education in health to prevent the formation of
pressure ulcers within this population. Keywords: Spinal Cord Injuries,
Pressure Ulcer, Sensory Substitution, Health Education, Biomedical Informatics.
"
0,290,"  Multicanonical molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful technique for sampling
conformations on rugged potential surfaces such as protein. However, it is
notoriously difficult to estimate the multicanonical temperature effectively.
Wang and Landau developed a convenient method for estimating the density of
states based on a multicanonical Monte Carlo method. In their method, the
density of states is calculated autonomously during a simulation. In this paper
we develop a set of techniques to effectively apply the Wang-Landau method to
MD simulations. In the multicanonical MD, the estimation of the derivative of
the density of states is critical. In order to estimate it accurately, we
devise two original improvements. First, the correction for the density of
states is made smooth by using the Gaussian distribution obtained by a short
canonical simulation. Second, an approximation is applied to the derivative,
which is based on the Gaussian distribution and the multiple weighted histogram
technique. A test of this method was performed with small polypeptides,
Met-enkephalin and Trp-cage, and it is demonstrated that Wang-Landau MD is
consistent with replica exchange MD but can sample much larger conformational
space.
"
0,291,"  We investigate the behaviour of an original traffic model. The model
considers a single multi-lane street, populated by autonomous vehicles directed
from either end to the other. Lanes have no intrinsic directionality, and the
vehicles are inserted at random at either end and any lane. Collision avoidance
is fully automatic and, to enhance the transport capacity of the street,
vehicles form_trains_ in which they may travel at high speed quite close to the
vehicle in front.
  We report on the transit times for vehicles under a wide variety of
conditions: vehicle insertion probability & imbalance and their maximum speed
distribution. We also outline an interesting feature of the model, that the
complex interactions of many vehicles are considerably more powerful than a
simple ""keep left"" directive which each vehicle should obey.
"
0,292,"  The harmonic emission from cluster nanoplasmas subject to short, intense
infrared laser pulses is analyzed by means of particle-in-cell simulations. A
pronounced resonant enhancement of the low-order harmonic yields is found when
the Mie plasma frequency of the ionizing and expanding cluster resonates with
the respective harmonic frequency. We show that a strong, nonlinear resonant
coupling of the cluster electrons with the laser field inhibits coherent
electron motion, suppressing the emitted radiation and restricting the spectrum
to only low-order harmonics. A pump-probe scheme is suggested to monitor the
ionization dynamics of the expanding clusters.
"
0,293,"  We have performed a simulation study of Langmuir turbulence in the Earth's
ionosphere by means of a Zakharov model with parameters relevant for the F
layer. The model includes dissipative terms to model collisions and Landau
damping of the electrons and ions, and a linear density profile, which models
the ionospheric plasma inhomogeneity whose length scale is of the order 10--100
km. The injection of energy into the system is modeled by a constant source
term in the Zakharov equation. Langmuir turbulence is excited ``on-demand'' in
controlled ionospheric modification experiments where the energy is provided by
an HF radio beam injected into the overhead ionospheric plasma. The ensuing
turbulence can be studied with radars and in the form of secondary radiation
recorded by ground-based receivers. We have analyzed spectral signatures of the
turbulence for different sets of parameters and different altitudes relative to
the turning point of the linear Langmuir mode where the Langmuir frequency
equals the local plasma frequency. By a parametric analysis, we have derived a
simple scaling law, which links the spectral width of the turbulent frequency
spectrum to the physical parameters in the ionosphere. The scaling law provides
a quantitative relation between the physical parameters (temperatures, electron
number density, ionospheric length scale, etc.) and the observed frequency
spectrum. This law may be useful for interpreting experimental results.
"
0,294,"  We analyze several possibilities for precisely measuring electronic
transitions in atomic helium by the direct use of phase-stabilized femtosecond
frequency combs. Because the comb is self-calibrating and can be shifted into
the ultraviolet spectral region via harmonic generation, it offers the prospect
of greatly improved accuracy for UV and far-UV transitions. To take advantage
of this accuracy an ultracold helium sample is needed. For measurements of the
triplet spectrum a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to cool and trap
metastable 2^3S state atoms. We analyze schemes for measuring the two-photon
$2^3S \to 4^3S$ interval, and for resonant two-photon excitation to high
Rydberg states, $2^3S \to 3^3P \to n^3S,D$. We also analyze experiments on the
singlet-state spectrum. To accomplish this we propose schemes for producing and
trapping ultracold helium in the 1^1S or 2^1S state via intercombination
transitions. A particularly intriguing scenario is the possibility of measuring
the $1^1S \to 2^1S$ transition with extremely high accuracy by use of
two-photon excitation in a magic wavelength trap that operates identically for
both states. We predict a ``triple magic wavelength'' at 412 nm that could
facilitate numerous experiments on trapped helium atoms, because here the
polarizabilities of the 1^1S, 2^1S and 2^3S states are all similar, small, and
positive.
"
0,295,"  The symmetric heavy-light ansatz is a method for finding the ground state of
any dilute unpolarized system of attractive two-component fermions.
Operationally it can be viewed as a generalization of the Kohn-Sham equations
in density functional theory applied to N-body density correlations. While the
original Hamiltonian has an exact Z_2 symmetry, the heavy-light ansatz breaks
this symmetry by skewing the mass ratio of the two components. In the limit
where one component is infinitely heavy, the many-body problem can be solved in
terms of single-particle orbitals. The original Z_2 symmetry is recovered by
enforcing Z_2 symmetry as a constraint on N-body density correlations for the
two components. For the 1D, 2D, and 3D attractive Hubbard models the method is
in very good agreement with exact Lanczos calculations for few-body systems at
arbitrary coupling. For the 3D attractive Hubbard model there is very good
agreement with lattice Monte Carlo results for many-body systems in the limit
of infinite scattering length.
"
0,296,"  Image and video quality in Long Range Observation Systems (LOROS) suffer from
atmospheric turbulence that causes small neighbourhoods in image frames to
chaotically move in different directions and substantially hampers visual
analysis of such image and video sequences. The paper presents a real-time
algorithm for perfecting turbulence degraded videos by means of stabilization
and resolution enhancement. The latter is achieved by exploiting the turbulent
motion. The algorithm involves generation of a reference frame and estimation,
for each incoming video frame, of a local image displacement map with respect
to the reference frame; segmentation of the displacement map into two classes:
stationary and moving objects and resolution enhancement of stationary objects,
while preserving real motion. Experiments with synthetic and real-life
sequences have shown that the enhanced videos, generated in real time, exhibit
substantially better resolution and complete stabilization for stationary
objects while retaining real motion.
"
0,297,"  Author offers and researched the new and revolutionary inflatable
electrostatic AB space towers (mast, new space elevator) up to one hundred
twenty thousands kilometers (or more) in height. The main innovation is filling
the tower by electron gas, which can create pressure up one atmosphere, has
negligible small weight and surprising properties.
  The suggested mast has following advantages in comparison with conventional
space elevator: 1. Electrostatic AB tower may be built from Earth surface
without the employment of any rockets. That decreases the cost of electrostatic
mast by thousands of times. 2. One can have any height and has a big control
load capacity. 3. Electrostatic tower can have the height of a geosynchronous
orbit (36,000 km) WITHOUT the additional top cable as the space elevator (up
120,000 - 160,000 km) and counterweight (equalizer) of hundreds of tons. 4. The
offered mast has less total mass than conventional space elevator. 5. The
offered tower can have the high-speed electrostatic climbers moved by
high-voltage electricity from Earth's surface. 6. The electrostatic mast can
bend in any needed direction when we give the necessary electric voltage in the
required parts of the extended mast. 7. Control mast has stability for any
altitude. Three projects 100 km, 36,000km (GEO), 120,000 km are computed and
presented.
"
0,298,"  A new method to coherently control the electron dynamics is proposed using a
few-cycle laser pulse in combination with a controlling field. It is shown that
this method not only broadens the attosecond pulse bandwidth, but also reduces
the chirp, then an isolated 80-as pulse is straightforwardly obtained and even
shorter pulse is achievable by increasing the intensity of the controlling
field. Such ultrashort pulses allow one to investigate ultrafast electronic
processes which have never be achieved before. In addition, the few-cycle
synthesized pulse is expected to manipulate a wide range of laser-atom
interactions.
"
0,299,"  In analogy with the load and the metage in hydrodynamics, we define
magnetohydrodynamic load and magnetohydrodynamic metage in the case of
magnetofluids. They can be used to write the magnetic field in MHD in Clebsch's
form. We show how these two concepts can be utilised to derive the magnetic
analogue of the Ertel's theorem and also, how in the presence of non-trivial
topology of the magnetic field in the magnetofluid one may associate the
linking number of the magnetic field lines with the invariant MHD loads. The
paper illustrates that the symmetry translation of the MHD metage in the
corresponding label space generates the conservation of cross helicity.
"
0,300,"  The CALICE collaboration is presently constructing a test hadron calorimeter
(HCAL) with 7620 scintillator tiles read out by novel photo-detectors - Silicon
Photomultipliers (SiPMs). This prototype is the first device which uses SiPMs
on a large scale. We present the design of the HCAL and report on measured
properties of more than 10 thousand SiPMs. We discuss the SiPM efficiency,
gain, cross-talk, and noise rate dependence on bias voltage and temperature,
including the spread in these parameters. We analyze the reasons for SiPM
rejection and present the results of the long term stability studies. The first
measurements of the SiPM radiation hardness are presented. We compare
properties of SiPM with the properties of similar devices, MRS APD and MPPC. A
possibility to make the tiles thinner and to read them out without WLS fibers
has been studied.
