Label,Number,Abstract
2,1,"  We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use
it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and
algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of
graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have
received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored
pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and
give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We
also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the
$(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between
pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and
Westermann and Hendrickson.
"
2,2,"  We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic
single-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to
certain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate the
determinant.
"
2,3,"  In this paper we show how to compute the $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ norm, $\alpha\ge
0$, using the dyadic grid. This result is a consequence of the description of
the Hardy spaces $H^p(R^N)$ in terms of dyadic and special atoms.
"
2,4,"  Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph
defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play
an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed
in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary
dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known
results are given.
  The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and
contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes
from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite
partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.
"
2,5,"  In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke eigensystems of
Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number
one. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field
$\Q(\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that
are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.
"
2,6,"  Recently, Bruinier and Ono classified cusp forms $f(z) := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
a_f(n)q ^n \in S_{\lambda+1/2}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)\cap \mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ that does
not satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo odd primes $p$. In this
paper, using Rankin-Cohen Bracket, we extend this result to modular forms of
half integral weight for primes $p \geq 5$. As applications of our main theorem
we derive distribution properties, for modulo primes $p\geq5$, of traces of
singular moduli and Hurwitz class number. We also study an analogue of Newman's
conjecture for overpartitions.
"
2,7,"  Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of
modular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ for $p=2,3,5,7$. In this paper, we extend
the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight
on $\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$. A proof is based on linear relations among
Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications
we obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient of
Eisentein series and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a certain point
are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of
Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.
"
2,8,"  In this article we discuss a relation between the string topology and
differential forms based on the theory of Chen's iterated integrals and the
cyclic bar complex.
"
2,9,"  In this note we give a new method for getting a series of approximations for
the extinction probability of the one-dimensional contact process by using the
Gr\""obner basis.
"
2,10,"  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential
equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth
finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport
along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.
Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid
body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by
two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.
"
2,11,"  Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from
N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent
singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free
networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a
meta-fractal or ""Sky"" when it is interpreted as the ""strut constant"" (S) of an
ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called ""Box-Kites"" (the fundamental
building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or ""recipes""
provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context
of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity.
"
2,12,"  We prove pfaffian and hafnian versions of Lieb's inequalities on determinants
and permanents of positive semi-definite matrices. We use the hafnian
inequality to improve the lower bound of R\'ev\'esz and Sarantopoulos on the
norm of a product of linear functionals on a real Euclidean space (this subject
is sometimes called the `real linear polarization constant' problem).
"
2,13,"  As in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence, the notion of
conditional freeness is meaningful when complex-valued states are replaced by
positive conditional expectations. In this framework, the paper presents
several positivity results, a version of the central limit theorem and an
analogue of the conditionally free R-transform constructed by means of
multilinear function series.
"
2,14,"  We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of
Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a
natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a
classical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then
proving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group)
in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on
a given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity
assumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal
object in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth
isometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct
a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold
which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the
quantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups
of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum
double torus defined in \cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of
holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.
"
2,15,"  In a quantum mechanical model, Diosi, Feldmann and Kosloff arrived at a
conjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is the
relative entropy as system size goes to infinity. The conjecture is proven in
this paper for density matrices. The first proof is analytic and uses the
quantum law of large numbers. The second one clarifies the relation to channel
capacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. Both proofs lead to
generalization of the conjecture.
"
2,16,"  We present an algorithm that produces the classification list of smooth Fano
d-polytopes for any given d. The input of the algorithm is a single number,
namely the positive integer d. The algorithm has been used to classify smooth
Fano d-polytopes for d<=7. There are 7622 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano
6-polytopes and 72256 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 7-polytopes.
"
2,17,"  The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of the
theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or
intrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most
commonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,
Landesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,
semi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent,
$C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of
the second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like,
$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant
curvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global
definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various
relationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler
manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved
globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting
identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the
curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely
global, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local
counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special
Finsler spaces considered.
"
2,18,"  In this paper we consider the Hardy-Lorentz spaces $H^{p,q}(R^n)$, with
$0<p\le 1$, $0<q\le \infty$. We discuss the atomic decomposition of the
elements in these spaces, their interpolation properties, and the behavior of
singular integrals and other operators acting on them.
"
2,19,"  Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects
associated with sections of star bodies and invoking
  Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier
analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized
cosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to
investigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call
$\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the
sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of
$L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional
subspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine
transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to
the study of sections of $\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of
this class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some
known facts and give them new proofs.
"
2,20,"  We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an
infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is
comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure
coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the
Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their
calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new
rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in
the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the
product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a
stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive
formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using
combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from
that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the
multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general
linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A.
Okounkov and G. Olshanski.
"
2,21,"  In the article [Petojevic 2006], A. Petojevi\' c verified useful properties
of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions which generalize Kurepa's [Kurepa 1971] left
factorial function. In this note, we present simplified proofs of two of these
results and we answer the open question stated in [Petojevic 2006]. Finally, we
discuss the differential transcendency of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions.
"
2,22,"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not
necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a
result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.
"
2,23,"  In present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of
some types of nonlinear PDEs in closed form. The method is based on
decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders.
It is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedure(s),
each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary PDEs system(s) for
one dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expression
of the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE.
Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in its
highest derivatives.
  The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can really
solve many of different order PDEs with different number of independent
variables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstrate
a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs.
"
2,24,"  We treat Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem from the analytic (or differential
geometric) viewpoint. More precisely, we give a curvature condition which
implies Koll\'ar type cohomology injectivity theorems. Our main theorem is
formulated for a compact K\""ahler manifold, but the proof uses the space of
harmonic forms on a Zariski open set with a suitable complete K\""ahler metric.
We need neither covering tricks, desingularizations, nor Leray's spectral
sequence.
"
2,25,"  This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in
which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita
$\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local
projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in
which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the
bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita
semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will
be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish
equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories
of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum.
We end up with applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules and
injective right wide Morita contexts.
"
2,26,"  We define nonselfadjoint operator algebras with generators $L_{e_1},...,
L_{e_n}, L_{f_1},...,L_{f_m}$ subject to the unitary commutation relations of
the form \[ L_{e_i}L_{f_j} = \sum_{k,l} u_{i,j,k,l} L_{f_l}L_{e_k}\] where $u=
(u_{i,j,k,l})$ is an $nm \times nm$ unitary matrix. These algebras, which
generalise the analytic Toeplitz algebras of rank 2 graphs with a single
vertex, are classified up to isometric isomorphism in terms of the matrix $u$.
"
2,27,"  We discussed quantum deformations of D=4 Lorentz and Poincare algebras. In
the case of Poincare algebra it is shown that almost all classical r-matrices
of S. Zakrzewski classification correspond to twisted deformations of Abelian
and Jordanian types. A part of twists corresponding to the r-matrices of
Zakrzewski classification are given in explicit form.
"
2,28,"  We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of
one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles
that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds.
Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles
collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass
and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the
asymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\to \infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the
number of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our
main result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on
the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states
that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of
neighbor particles.
"
2,29,"  Our main result in this paper is the following: Given $H^m, H^n$ hyperbolic
spaces of dimensional $m$ and $n$ corresponding, and given a Holder function
$f=(s^1,...,f^{n-1}):\partial H^m\to \partial H^n$ between geometric boundaries
of $H^m$ and $H^n$. Then for each $\epsilon >0$ there exists a harmonic map
$u:H^m\to H^n$ which is continuous up to the boundary (in the sense of
Euclidean) and $u|_{\partial H^m}=(f^1,...,f^{n-1},\epsilon)$.
"
2,30,"  We combine classical methods of combinatorial group theory with the theory of
small cancellations over relatively hyperbolic groups to construct finitely
generated torsion-free groups that have only finitely many classes of conjugate
elements. Moreover, we present several results concerning embeddings into such
groups.
  As another application of these techniques, we prove that every countable
group $C$ can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of a group $N$,
where $N$ is a finitely generated group having Kazhdan's property (T) and
containing exactly two conjugacy classes.
"
2,31,"  We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally
compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the
geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show
that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie
group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an
asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a
limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss
the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to
ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant
metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series
of nilpotent groups.
"
2,32,"  We review recent progress in operator algebraic approach to conformal quantum
field theory. Our emphasis is on use of representation theory in classification
theory. This is based on a series of joint works with R. Longo.
"
2,33,"  Sparse Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a variation on the standard CDMA
method in which the spreading (signature) matrix contains only a relatively
small number of non-zero elements, is presented and analysed using methods of
statistical physics. The analysis provides results on the performance of
maximum likelihood decoding for sparse spreading codes in the large system
limit. We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreading
matrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN) with a
comparison to the canonical (dense) random spreading code.
"
2,34,"  For positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, Ando and Zhan proved the
inequalities $||| f(A)+f(B) ||| \ge ||| f(A+B) |||$ and $||| g(A)+g(B) ||| \le
||| g(A+B) |||$, for any unitarily invariant norm, and for any non-negative
operator monotone $f$ on $[0,\infty)$ with inverse function $g$. These
inequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concave
functions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama,
and Kosem, respectively.
  In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $|||
f(A)-f(B) ||| \le ||| f(|A-B|) |||$, and $||| g(A)-g(B) ||| \ge ||| g(|A-B|)
|||$, obtained by Ando, for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, also have a
similar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answer
exactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmatively
in the special case when $A\ge ||B||$.
  In the course of this work, we introduce the novel notion of $Y$-dominated
majorisation between the spectra of two Hermitian matrices, where $Y$ is itself
a Hermitian matrix, and prove a certain property of this relation that allows
to strengthen the results of Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem, mentioned above.
"
2,35,"  We prove a duality theorem for certain graded algebras and show by various
examples different kinds of failure of tameness of local cohomology.
"
2,36,"  Given an orientable weakly self-dual manifold X of rank two, we build a
geometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C) as a naturally defined algebra
L of endomorphisms of the space of differential forms of X. We provide an
explicit description of Serre generators in terms of natural generators of L.
This construction gives a bundle on X which is related to the search for a
natural Gauge theory on X. We consider this paper as a first step in the study
of a rich and interesting algebraic structure.
"
2,37,"  We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of
sets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by
symplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of
rigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment
maps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (following
the works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possibly
singular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth
functions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity
of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the
Floer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.
"
2,38,"  We prove that an arbitrary (not necessarily countably generated) Hilbert
$G$-$\cla$ module on a G-C^* algebra $\cla$ admits an equivariant embedding
into a trivial $G-\cla$ module, provided G is a compact Lie group and its
action on $\cla$ is ergodic.
"
2,39,"  We give details of the proof of the remark made in \cite{G2} that the Chern
characters of the canonical generators on the K homology of the quantum group
$SU_q(2)$ are not invariant under the natural $SU_q(2)$ coaction. Furthermore,
the conjecture made in \cite{G2} about the nontriviality of the twisted Chern
character coming from an odd equivariant spectral triple on $SU_q(2)$ is
settled in the affirmative.
"
2,40,"  Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from
N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent
singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free
networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a
meta-fractal or ""Sky"" when it is interpreted as the ""strut constant"" (S) of an
ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called ""Box-Kites"" (the fundamental
building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or ""recipes""
provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context
of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity.
"
2,41,"  We will prove the relative homotopy principle for smooth maps with
singularities of a given {\cal K}-invariant class with a mild condition. We
next study a filtration of the group of homotopy self-equivalences of a given
manifold P by considering singularities of non-negative {\cal K}-codimensions.
"
2,42,"  We consider the variation of the surface spanned by closed strings in a
spacetime manifold. Using the Nambu-Goto string action, we induce the geodesic
surface equation, the geodesic surface deviation equation which yields a Jacobi
field, and we define the index form of a geodesic surface as in the case of
point particles to discuss conjugate strings on the geodesic surface.
"
2,43,"  We prove the existence of global Bishop discs in a strictly pseudoconvex
Stein domain in an almost complex manifold of complex dimension 2.
"
2,44,"  In this note we develop tools and techniques for the treatment of anisotropic
thermo-elasticity in two space dimensions. We use a diagonalisation technique
to obtain properties of the characteristic roots of the full symbol of the
system in order to prove $L^p$--$L^q$ decay rates for its solutions.
"
2,45,"  In this paper we show that the quotient Aubry set associated to certain
Lagrangians is totally disconnected (i.e., every connected component consists
of a single point). Moreover, we discuss the relation between this problem and
a Morse-Sard type property for (difference of) critical subsolutions of
Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
"
2,46,"  Over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p>2, prolongations of the
simple finite dimensional Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix
are studied for certain simplest gradings of these algebras. Several new simple
Lie superalgebras are discovered, serial and exceptional, including superBrown
and superMelikyan superalgebras. Simple Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix of
rank 2 are classified.
"
2,47,"  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$
foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.
"
2,48,"  Let g be a finite dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, and let V be a
finite dimensional represenation of g. We give a closed formula for the mth
Frobenius-Schur indicator, m>1, of V in representation-theoretic terms. We
deduce that the indicators take integer values, and that for a large enough m,
the mth indicator of V equals the dimension of the zero weight space of V. For
the classical Lie algebras sl(n), so(2n), so(2n+1) and sp(2n), this is the case
for m greater or equal to 2n-1, 4n-5, 4n-3 and 2n+1, respectively.
"
2,49,"  The groups G_{k,1} of Richard Thompson and Graham Higman can be generalized
in a natural way to monoids, that we call M_{k,1}, and to inverse monoids,
called Inv_{k,1}; this is done by simply generalizing bijections to partial
functions or partial injective functions. The monoids M_{k,1} have connections
with circuit complexity (studied in another paper). Here we prove that M_{k,1}
and Inv_{k,1} are congruence-simple for all k. Their Green relations J and D
are characterized: M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are J-0-simple, and they have k-1
non-zero D-classes. They are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz
algebra O_k. They are finitely generated, and their word problem over any
finite generating set is in P. Their word problem is coNP-complete over certain
infinite generating sets.
  Changes in this version: Section 4 has been thoroughly revised, and errors
have been corrected; however, the main results of Section 4 do not change.
Sections 1, 2, and 3 are unchanged, except for the proof of Theorem 2.3, which
was incomplete; a complete proof was published in the Appendix of reference
[6], and is also given here.
"
2,50,"  We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power
Frobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of
finite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admits
an analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C have
integral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As a
consequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime power
dimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction of
twisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories (this
is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras in
terms of Manin pairs).
"
2,51,"  Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, a positive integer $d$, and
types $T_1,T_2,...,T_d$ (in the sense of the classification of finite Coxeter
groups), we compute the number of decompositions $c=\si_1\si_2 cdots\si_d$ of a
Coxeter element $c$ of $W$, such that $\si_i$ is a Coxeter element in a
subgroup of type $T_i$ in $W$, $i=1,2,...,d$, and such that the factorisation
is ""minimal"" in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the $T_i$'s,
$i=1,2,...,d$, equals the rank of $W$. For the exceptional types, these
decomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$
decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a
somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$
decomposition numbers from results of B\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on
map enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.
These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and
fixed integers $r_1\le r_2\le ...\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\pi_1\le
\pi_2\le ...\le \pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions
poset, where the poset rank of $\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the ""block
structure"" of $\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies
all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing
partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain
enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.
Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain
enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,
in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.
"
2,52,"  Associated to the classical Weyl groups, we introduce the notion of
degenerate spin affine Hecke algebras and affine Hecke-Clifford algebras. For
these algebras, we establish the PBW properties, formulate the intertwiners,
and describe the centers. We further develop connections of these algebras with
the usual degenerate (i.e. graded) affine Hecke algebras of Lusztig by
introducing a notion of degenerate covering affine Hecke algebras.
"
2,53,"  We classify all fusion categories for a given set of fusion rules with three
simple object types. If a conjecture of Ostrik is true, our classification
completes the classification of fusion categories with three simple object
types. To facilitate the discussion we describe a convenient, concrete and
useful variation of graphical calculus for fusion categories, discuss
pivotality and sphericity in this framework, and give a short and elementary
re-proof of the fact that the quadruple dual functor is naturally isomorphic to
the identity.
"
2,54,"  We extend our previous classification of superpotentials of ``scalar
curvature type"" for the cohomogeneity one Ricci-flat equations. We now consider
the case not covered in our previous paper, i.e., when some weight vector of
the superpotential lies outside (a scaled translate of) the convex hull of the
weight vectors associated with the scalar curvature function of the principal
orbit. In this situation we show that either the isotropy representation has at
most 3 irreducible summands or the first order subsystem associated to the
superpotential is of the same form as the Calabi-Yau condition for submersion
type metrics on complex line bundles over a Fano K\""ahler-Einstein product.
"
2,55,"  The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum
outdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large
digraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on
the minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of
Manoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which
ensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every
ordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which
encounters these vertices in this order.
"
2,56,"  In this note we consider the time of the collision $\tau$ for $n$ independent
Brownian motions $X^1_t,...,X_t^n$ with drifts $a_1,...,a_n$, each starting
from $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$, where $x_1<...<x_n$. We show the exact asymptotics of
$P_x(\tau>t) = C h(x)t^{-\alpha}e^{-\gamma t}(1 + o(1))$ as $t\to\infty$ and
identify $C,h(x),\alpha,\gamma$ in terms of the drifts.
"
2,57,"  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the
receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively
activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.
"
2,58,"  We provide a description of the interpolating and sampling sequences on a
space of holomorphic functions with a uniform growth restriction defined on
finite Riemann surfaces.
"
2,59,"  We prove that the limit hypersurfaces of converging curvature flows are
stable, if the initial velocity has a weak sign, and give a survey of the
existence and regularity results.
"
2,60,"  There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical
possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.
The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1}
is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and
permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular
transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking
in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.
This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical
problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the
permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked
objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the
electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that
the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially
self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily
equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the
coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the
scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the
construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and
active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove
cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove
that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.
"
2,61,"  These notes accompany a lecture about the topology of symplectic (and other)
quotients. The aim is two-fold: first to advertise the ease of computation in
the symplectic category; and second to give an account of some new computations
for weighted projective spaces. We start with a brief exposition of how
orbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used to
understand their topology. We then show how these results can be used to
compute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplectic
reductions. We conclude by comparing the several rings associated to a weighted
projective space. We make these computations directly, avoiding any mention of
a stacky fan or of a labeled moment polytope.
"
2,62,"  In trigonometric series terms all polyharmonic functions inside the unit disk
are described. For such functions it is proved the existence of their boundary
values on the unit circle in the space of hyperfunctions. The necessary and
sufficient conditions are presented for the boundary value to belong to certain
subspaces of the space of hyperfunctions.
"
2,63,"  In a previous paper, we showed how certain orientations of the edges of a
graph G embedded in a closed oriented surface S can be understood as discrete
spin structures on S. We then used this correspondence to give a geometric
proof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model on
G. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compact
oriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting and
gluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition
function. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum
field theory on surface graphs.
"
2,64,"  It is known that every closed curve of length \leq 4 in R^n (n>0) can be
surrounded by a sphere of radius 1, and that this is the best bound. Letting S
denote the circle of circumference 4, with the arc-length metric, we here
express this fact by saying that the ""mapping radius"" of S in R^n is 1.
  Tools are developed for estimating the mapping radius of a metric space X in
a metric space Y. In particular, it is shown that for X a bounded metric space,
the supremum of the mapping radii of X in all convex subsets of normed metric
spaces is equal to the infimum of the sup norms of all convex linear
combinations of the functions d(x,-): X --> R (x\in X).
  Several explicit mapping radii are calculated, and open questions noted.
"
2,65,"  Let X be a simplicial complex on the vertex set V. The rational Leray number
L(X) of X is the minimal d such that the rational reduced homology of any
induced subcomplex of X vanishes in dimensions d and above. Let \pi be a
simplicial map from X to a simplex Y, such that the cardinality of the preimage
of any point in |Y| is at most r. It is shown that L(\pi(X)) \leq r L(X)+r-1.
One consequence is a topological extension of a Helly type result of Amenta.
"
2,66,"  This paper considers the use of punctured convolutional codes to obtain
pragmatic space-time trellis codes over block-fading channel. We show that good
performance can be achieved even when puncturation is adopted and that we can
still employ the same Viterbi decoder of the convolutional mother code by using
approximated metrics without increasing the complexity of the decoding
operations.
"
2,67,"  We show that there is a unique Markov trace on the tower of Temperley--Lieb
type quotients of Hecke algebras of Coxeter type $E_n$ (for all $n \geq 6$). We
explain in detail how this trace may be computed easily using tom Dieck's
calculus of diagrams. As applications, we show how to use the trace to show
that the diagram representation is faithful, and to compute leading
coefficients of certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials.
"
2,68,"  The paper presents a survey of mathematical problems, techniques, and
challenges arising in the Thermoacoustic and Photoacoustic Tomography.
"
2,69,"  Let ${\mathcal S}(\R)$ be an o-minimal structure over $\R$, $T \subset
\R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}$ a closed definable set, and $$ \displaylines{\pi_1:
\R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}\to \R^{k_1 + k_2}, \pi_2: \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}\to \R^{\ell}, \
\pi_3: \R^{k_1 + k_2} \to \R^{k_2}} $$ the projection maps.
  For any collection ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of subsets of
$\R^{k_1+k_2}$, and $\z \in \R^{k_2}$, let $\A_\z$ denote the collection of
subsets of $\R^{k_1}$, $\{A_{1,\z},..., A_{n,\z}\}$, where $A_{i,\z} = A_i \cap
\pi_3^{-1}(\z), 1 \leq i \leq n$. We prove that there exists a constant $C =
C(T) > 0,$ such that for any family ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of
definable sets, where each $A_i = \pi_1(T \cap \pi_2^{-1}(\y_i))$, for some
$\y_i \in \R^{\ell}$, the number of distinct stable homotopy types of $\A_\z,
\z \in \R^{k_2}$, is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C \cdot n^{(k_1+1)k_2},} $
while the number of distinct homotopy types is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C
\cdot n^{(k_1+3)k_2}.} $ This generalizes to the general o-minimal setting,
bounds of the same type proved in \cite{BV} for semi-algebraic and
semi-Pfaffian families. One main technical tool used in the proof of the above
results, is a topological comparison theorem which might be of independent
interest in the study of arrangements.
"
2,70,"  For an arbitrary operator A on a Banach space X which is a generator of
C_0-group with certain growth condition at the infinity, the direct theorems on
connection between the smoothness degree of a vector $x\in X$ with respect to
the operator A, the order of convergence to zero of the best approximation of x
by exponential type entire vectors for the operator A, and the k-module of
continuity are given. Obtained results allows to acquire Jackson-type
inequalities in many classic spaces of periodic functions and weighted $L_p$
spaces.
"
2,71,"  For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projection
pursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high
dimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly
dependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which
is robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is
identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of
the response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a
genuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for
the single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent
and asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is
sufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within
seconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates
with the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive
flow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.
"
2,72,"  This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information,
especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional
studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and
cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the
physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,
are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently
as information becoming more complex.
  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple
scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,
psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used
to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.
"
2,73,"  We lead the algorithm of expansion of sojourn probability of many-dimensional
diffusion processes in small domain. The principal member of this expansion
defines normalizing coefficient for special limit theorems.
"
2,74,"  We show that if a complete Riemannian manifold supports a vector field such
that the Ricci tensor plus the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to the
vector field has a positive lower bound, then the fundamental group is finite.
In particular, it follows that complete shrinking Ricci solitons and complete
smooth metric measure spaces with a positive lower bound on the Bakry-Emery
tensor have finite fundamental group. The method of proof is to generalize
arguments of Garcia-Rio and Fernandez-Lopez in the compact case.
"
2,75,"  We study the pseudospectrum of a class of non-selfadjoint differential
operators. Our work consists in a detailed study of the microlocal properties,
which rule the spectral stability or instability phenomena appearing under
small perturbations for elliptic quadratic differential operators. The class of
elliptic quadratic differential operators stands for the class of operators
defined in the Weyl quantization by complex-valued elliptic quadratic symbols.
We establish in this paper a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the
Weyl symbol of these operators, which ensures the stability of their spectra.
When this condition is violated, we prove that it occurs some strong spectral
instabilities for the high energies of these operators, in some regions which
can be far away from their spectra. We give a precise geometrical description
of them, which explains the results obtained for these operators in some
numerical simulations giving the computation of false eigenvalues far from
their spectra by algorithms for eigenvalues computing.
"
2,76,"  Product probability property, known in the literature as statistical
independence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, all
of which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature
of the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic
functional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon
entropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having
product probability property. It is argued that the natural process is
non-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in
product probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the
involvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function.
Generalizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some
of the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy
leads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related
differential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of
""inaccuracy"" is also explored.
"
2,77,"  This paper deals with the investigation of the solution of an unified
fractional reaction-diffusion equation associated with the Caputo derivative as
the time-derivative and Riesz-Feller fractional derivative as the
space-derivative. The solution is derived by the application of the Laplace and
Fourier transforms in closed form in terms of the H-function. The results
derived are of general nature and include the results investigated earlier by
many authors, notably by Mainardi et al. (2001, 2005) for the fundamental
solution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation, and Saxena et al.
(2006a, b) for fractional reaction- diffusion equations. The advantage of using
Riesz-Feller derivative lies in the fact that the solution of the fractional
reaction-diffusion equation containing this derivative includes the fundamental
solution for space-time fractional diffusion, which itself is a generalization
of neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and
time-fractional diffusion. These specialized types of diffusion can be
interpreted as spatial probability density functions evolving in time and are
expressible in terms of the H-functions in compact form.
"
2,78,"  We build a sequence of empirical measures on the space D(R_+,R^d) of
R^d-valued c\`adl\`ag functions on R_+ in order to approximate the law of a
stationary R^d-valued Markov and Feller process (X_t). We obtain some general
results of convergence of this sequence. Then, we apply them to Brownian
diffusions and solutions to L\'evy driven SDE's under some Lyapunov-type
stability assumptions. As a numerical application of this work, we show that
this procedure gives an efficient way of option pricing in stochastic
volatility models.
"
2,79,"  A class of three-dimensional initial data characterized by uniformly large
vorticity is considered for the Euler equations of incompressible fluids. The
fast singular oscillating limits of the Euler equations are studied for
parametrically resonant cylinders. Resonances of fast swirling Beltrami waves
deplete the Euler nonlinearity. The resonant Euler equations are systems of
three-dimensional rigid body equations, coupled or not. Some cases of these
resonant systems have homoclinic cycles, and orbits in the vicinity of these
homoclinic cycles lead to bursts of the Euler solution measured in Sobolev
norms of order higher than that corresponding to the enstrophy.
"
2,80,"  Cofibrations are defined in the category of Fr\""olicher spaces by weakening
the analog of the classical definition to enable smooth homotopy extensions to
be more easily constructed, using flattened unit intervals. We later relate
smooth cofibrations to smooth neighborhood deformation retracts. The notion of
smooth neighborhood deformation retract gives rise to an analogous result that
a closed Fr\""olicher subspace $A$ of the Fr\""olicher space $X$ is a smooth
neighborhood deformation retract of $X$ if and only if the inclusion $i:
A\hookrightarrow X$ comes from a certain subclass of cofibrations. As an
application we construct the right Puppe sequence.
"
2,81,"  We present a simple proof of the resolvent estimates of elliptic Fourier
multipliers on the Euclidean space, and apply them to the analysis of
time-global and spatially-local smoothing estimates of a class of dispersive
equations. For this purpose we study in detail the properties of the
restriction of Fourier transform on the unit cotangent sphere associated with
the symbols of multipliers.
"
2,82,"  The Colin de Verdi\`ere number $\mu(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum corank
of a Colin de Verdi\`ere matrix for $G$ (that is, of a Schr\""odinger operator
on $G$ with a single negative eigenvalue). In 2001, Lov\'asz gave a
construction that associated to every convex 3-polytope a Colin de Verdi\`ere
matrix of corank 3 for its 1-skeleton.
  We generalize the Lov\'asz construction to higher dimensions by interpreting
it as minus the Hessian matrix of the volume of the polar dual. As a corollary,
$\mu(G) \ge d$ if $G$ is the 1-skeleton of a convex $d$-polytope.
  Determination of the signature of the Hessian of the volume is based on the
second Minkowski inequality for mixed volumes and on Bol's condition for
equality.
"
2,83,"  In this article we will first prove a result about convergence in capacity.
Using the achieved result we will obtain a general decompositon theorem for
complex Monge-Ampere measues which will be used to prove a comparison principle
for the complex Monge-Ampere operator.
"
2,84,"  It has been observed that particular rate-1/2 partially systematic parallel
concatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor than
that of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can
only be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards
low bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a
rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we
present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we
call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate
performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of
their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to
simulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the
error floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic
output. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of
improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its
error floor.
"
2,85,"  The problem of limit shapes in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary
conditions is addressed by considering a specially tailored bulk correlation
function, the emptiness formation probability. A closed expression of this
correlation function is given, both in terms of certain determinant and
multiple integral, which allows for a systematic treatment of the limit shapes
of the model for full range of values of vertex weights. Specifically, we show
that for vertex weights corresponding to the free-fermion line on the phase
diagram, the emptiness formation probability is related to a one-matrix model
with a triple logarithmic singularity, or Triple Penner model. The saddle-point
analysis of this model leads to the Arctic Circle Theorem, and its
generalization to the Arctic Ellipses, known previously from domino tilings.
"
2,86,"  We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $n\times n$ banded Toeplitz
matrices as $n\to \infty$. From classical results of Schmidt-Spitzer and
Hirschman it is known that the eigenvalues accumulate on a special curve in the
complex plane and the normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges weakly
to a measure on this curve as $n\to\infty$. In this paper, we characterize the
limiting measure in terms of an equilibrium problem. The limiting measure is
one component of the unique vector of measures that minimes an energy
functional defined on admissible vectors of measures. In addition, we show that
each of the other components is the limiting measure of the normalized counting
measure on certain generalized eigenvalues.
"
2,87,"  We study the high temperature phase of a family of typed branching diffusions
initially studied in [Ast\'{e}risque 236 (1996) 133--154] and [Lecture Notes in
Math. 1729 (2000) 239--256 Springer, Berlin]. The primary aim is to establish
some almost-sure limit results for the long-term behavior of this particle
system, namely the speed at which the population of particles colonizes both
space and type dimensions, as well as the rate at which the population grows
within this asymptotic shape. Our approach will include identification of an
explicit two-phase mechanism by which particles can build up in sufficient
numbers with spatial positions near $-\gamma t$ and type positions near $\kappa
\sqrt{t}$ at large times $t$. The proofs involve the application of a variety
of martingale techniques--most importantly a ``spine'' construction involving a
change of measure with an additive martingale. In addition to the model's
intrinsic interest, the methodologies presented contain ideas that will adapt
to other branching settings. We also briefly discuss applications to traveling
wave solutions of an associated reaction--diffusion equation.
"
2,88,"  A recent result of Balandraud shows that for every subset S of an abelian
group G, there exists a non trivial subgroup H such that |TS| <= |T|+|S|-2
holds only if the stabilizer of TS contains H. Notice that Kneser's Theorem
says only that the stabilizer of TS must be a non-zero subgroup.
  This strong form of Kneser's theorem follows from some nice properties of a
certain poset investigated by Balandraud. We consider an analogous poset for
nonabelian groups and, by using classical tools from Additive Number Theory,
extend some of the above results. In particular we obtain short proofs of
Balandraud's results in the abelian case.
"
2,89,"  We study the notion of Fagnano orbits for dual polygonal billiards. We used
them to characterize regular polygons and we study the iteration of the
developing map.
"
2,90,"  This paper deals with discrete-time Markov control processes on a general
state space. A long-run risk-sensitive average cost criterion is used as a
performance measure. The one-step cost function is nonnegative and possibly
unbounded. Using the vanishing discount factor approach, the optimality
inequality and an optimal stationary strategy for the decision maker are
established.
"
2,91,"  We show that the number of renewals up to time $t$ exhibits distributional
fluctuations as $t\to\infty$ if the underlying lifetimes increase at an
exponential rate in a distributional sense. This provides a probabilistic
explanation for the asymptotics of insertion depth in random trees generated by
a bit-comparison strategy from uniform input; we also obtain a representation
for the resulting family of limit laws along subsequences. Our approach can
also be used to obtain rates of convergence.
"
2,92,"  In this paper we study the shape of least-energy solutions to a singularly
perturbed quasilinear problem with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. We
use an intrinsic variation method to show that at limit, the global maximum
point of least-energy solutions goes to a point on the boundary faster than the
linear rate and this point on the boundary approaches to a point where the mean
curvature of the boundary achieves its maximum. We also give a complete proof
of exponential decay of least-energy solutions.
"
2,93,"  Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) living in the closures of
domains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability
because of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic
networks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and
directions of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for
SRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that
satisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in
the defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial
ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for
solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to
show weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance
principle, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some
sufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in
convex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the
polyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries
and possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.
"
2,94,"  It is shown that in the units of augmentation one of an integral group ring
$\mathbb{Z} G$ of a finite group $G$, a noncyclic subgroup of order $p^{2}$,
for some odd prime $p$, exists only if such a subgroup exists in $G$. The
corresponding statement for $p=2$ holds by the Brauer--Suzuki theorem, as
recently observed by W. Kimmerle.
"
2,95,"  As main result we show that for each g > 1 there is some translation surface
of genus g whose Veech group is a non congruence subgroup of SL(2,Z). We use
origamis/square-tiled surfaces to produce our examples. The article is divided
into two parts: In the first part we introduce translation surfaces, origamis,
Veech groups and Teichmueller curves and show for two origamis in genus 2 that
their Veech groups are non congruence groups; in the second part we provide a
technique that produces sequences of origamis whose Veech groups are
decreasing. This is used to prove the main result.
"
2,96,"  Thermodynamic stable interaction pair potentials which are not of the form
``positive function + real continuous function of positive type'' are presented
in dimension one. Construction of such a potential in dimension two is
sketched. These constructions use only elementary calculations. The
mathematical background is discussed separately.
"
2,97,"  In this note we describe the natural coordinatizations of a Delzant space
defined as a reduced phase space (symplectic geometry view-point) and give
explicit formulas for the coordinate transformations. For each fixed point of
the torus action on the Delzant polytope, we have a maximal coordinatization of
an open cell in the Delzant space which contains the fixed point. This cell is
equal to the domain of definition of one of the natural coordinatizations of
the Delzant space as a toric variety (complex algebraic geometry view-point),
and we give an explicit formula for the toric variety coordinates in terms of
the reduced phase space coordinates. We use considerations in the maximal
coordinate neighborhoods to give simple proofs of some of the basic facts about
the Delzant space, as a reduced phase space, and as a toric variety. These can
be viewed as a first application of the coordinatizations, and serve to make
the presentation more self-contained.
"
2,98,"  These notes, based on the paper ""Formal Solution of the Master Equation via
HPT and Deformation Theory"" by Huebschmann and Stasheff, were prepared for a
series of talks at Illinois State University with the intention of applying
Homological Perturbation Theory to the derived bracket constructions of
Kosmann-Schwarzbach and T. Voronov, and eventually writing Part II of the paper
""Higher Derived Brackets and Deformation Theory I"" by the present authors.
"
2,99,"  We present a variational formulation of electrodynamics using de Rham even
and odd differential forms. Our formulation relies on a variational principle
more complete than the Hamilton principle and thus leads to field equations
with external sources and permits the derivation of the constitutive relations.
We interpret a domain in space-time as an odd de Rham 4-current. This permits a
treatment of different types of boundary problems in an unified way. In
particular we obtain a smooth transition to the infinitesimal version by using
a current with a one point support.
"
2,100,"  A projective surface S is said to be isogenous to a product if there exist
two smooth curves C, F and a finite group G acting freely on C \times F so that
S=(C \times F)/G. In this paper we classify all surfaces with p_g=q=1 which are
isogenous to a product.
"
2,101,"  Let $\Gamma =(V,E)$ be a point-symmetric reflexive relation and let $v\in V$
such that
  $|\Gamma (v)|$ is finite (and hence $|\Gamma (x)|$ is finite for all $x$, by
the transitive action of the group of automorphisms). Let $j\in \N$ be an
integer such that $\Gamma ^j(v)\cap \Gamma ^{-}(v)=\{v\}$. Our main result
states that
  $$ |\Gamma ^{j} (v)|\ge | \Gamma ^{j-1} (v)| + |\Gamma (v)|-1.$$
  As an application we have $ |\Gamma ^{j} (v)| \ge 1+(|\Gamma (v)|-1)j.$ The
last result confirms a recent conjecture of Seymour in the case of
vertex-symmetric graphs. Also it gives a short proof for the validity of the
Caccetta-H\""aggkvist conjecture for vertex-symmetric graphs and generalizes an
additive result of Shepherdson.
"
2,102,"  We show a one-to-one correspondence between arrangements of d lines in the
projective plane, and lines in P^{d-2}. We apply this correspondence to
classify (3,q)-nets over the complex numbers for all q<=6. When q=6, we have
twelve possible combinatorial cases, but we prove that only nine of them are
realizable. This new case shows several new properties for 3-nets: different
dimensions for moduli, strict realization over certain fields, etc. We also
construct a three dimensional family of (3,8)-nets corresponding to the
Quaternion group.
"
2,103,"  In this note we contrast two transformation-based methods to deduce absolute

"
2,105,"  This paper is concerned with a shape sensitivity analysis of a viscous
incompressible fluid driven by Stokes equations with nonhomogeneous boundary
condition. The structure of shape gradient with respect to the shape of the
variable domain for a given cost function is established by using the
differentiability of a minimax formulation involving a Lagrangian functional
combining with function space parametrization technique or function space
embedding technique. We apply an gradient type algorithm to our problem.
Numerical examples show that our theory is useful for practical purpose and the
proposed algorithm is feasible.
"
2,106,"  Given a remarkable representation of the generalized Pauli operators of
two-qubits in terms of the points of the generalized quadrangle of order two,
W(2), it is shown that specific subsets of these operators can also be
associated with the points and lines of the four-dimensional projective space
over the Galois field with two elements - the so-called Veldkamp space of W(2).
An intriguing novelty is the recognition of (uni- and tri-centric) triads and
specific pentads of the Pauli operators in addition to the ""classical"" subsets
answering to geometric hyperplanes of W(2).
"

"
2,108,"  We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes can
help each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies in
the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the
myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing
problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the
source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the
decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative
coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by
the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative
coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms
of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm
runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that
runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when
the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies
using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of
the strategies on different routes.

solution to the Painlev\'e-I equation.
"
2,111,"  In this paper, we continue the study of the category of functors Fquad,
associated to F_2-vector spaces equipped with a nondegenerate quadratic form,
initiated in two previous papers of the author. We define a filtration of the
standard projective objects in Fquad; this refines to give a decomposition into
indecomposable factors of the two first standard projective objects in Fquad.
As an application of these two decompositions, we give a complete description
of the polynomial functors of the category Fquad.
"
2,112,"  We find a necessary and sufficient condition for a compact 7-manifold to

"
2,113,"  We consider a sequence of additive functionals {\phi_n}, set on a sequence of
Markov chains {X_n} that weakly converges to a Markov process X. We give
sufficient condition for such a sequence to converge in distribution,
formulated in terms of the characteristics of the additive functionals, and
related to the Dynkin's theorem on the convergence of W-functionals. As an
application of the main theorem, the general sufficient condition for
convergence of additive functionals in terms of transition probabilities of the
chains X_n is proved.
"
2,114,"  In this paper we study a class of backward stochastic differential equations
(BSDEs) of the form dY(t)= -AY(t)dt -f_0(t,Y(t))dt -f_1(t,Y(t),Z(t))dt +
Z(t)dW(t) on the interval [0,T], with given final condition at time T, in an
infinite dimensional Hilbert space H. The unbounded operator A is sectorial and
dissipative and the nonlinearity f_0(t,y) is dissipative and defined for y only
taking values in a subspace of H. A typical example is provided by the
so-called polynomial nonlinearities. Applications are given to stochastic
partial differential equations and spin systems.
"
2,115,"  A unified approach to (symmetric informationally complete) positive operator

"
2,116,"  This article discusses completeness of Boolean Algebra as First Order Theory
in Goedel's meaning. If Theory is complete then any possible transformation is
equivalent to some transformation using axioms, predicates etc. defined for
this theory. If formula is to be proved (or disproved) then it has to be
reduced to axioms. If every transformation is deducible then also optimal
transformation is deducible. If every transformation is exponential then
optimal one is too, what allows to define lower bound for discussed problem to
be exponential (outside P). Then we show algorithm for NDTM solving the same
problem in O(n^c) (so problem is in NP), what proves that P \neq NP.
  Article proves also that result of relativisation of P=NP question and oracle
shown by Baker-Gill-Solovay distinguish between deterministic and
non-deterministic calculation models. If there exists oracle A for which
P^A=NP^A then A consists of infinite number of algorithms, DTMs, axioms and
predicates, or like NDTM infinite number of simultaneous states.
"
2,117,"  Foods naturally contain a number of contaminants that may have different and
long term toxic effects. This paper introduces a novel approach for the
assessment of such chronic food risk that integrates the pharmacokinetic
properties of a given contaminant. The estimation of such a Kinetic Dietary
Exposure Model (KDEM) should be based on long term consumption data which, for
the moment, can only be provided by Household Budget Surveys such as the
SECODIP panel in France. A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose a
series of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used
as inputs of the KDEM. As an illustration, the risk assessment related to the
presence of methyl mercury in seafood is revisited using this novel approach.
"
2,118,"  As a continuation of Rabei et al. work [11], the Hamilton- Jacobi partial
differential equation is generalized to be applicable for systems containing

obtained in a similar manner to the usual mechanics. Two problems are
considered to demonstrate the application of the formalism. The result found to
be in exact agreement with Agrawal's formalism.
"
2,119,"  In this paper we investigate the optimal control problem for a class of

standard boundary conditions, as the value at the boundary is governed by a
different stochastic differential equation.
"
2,120,"  Wentzel, Kramers, Brillouin (WKB) approximation for fractional systems is

examples are investigated in details.
"
2,121,"  This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,
one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has
generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput
capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not
achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of ""canonical
networks"", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities
can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the
throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper
bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;
and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many
hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general
networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper
bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with
random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far
below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the
gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to
fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be
improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is
worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.
"
2,122,"  This article gives the proof of results announced in [J. Blanc, Finite
Abelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the plane, C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris,
S\'er. I 344 (2007), 21-26.] and some description of automorphisms of rational
surfaces.
  Given a finite Abelian subgroup of the Cremona group of the plane, we provide
a way to decide whether it is birationally conjugate to a group of
automorphisms of a minimal surface.
  In particular, we prove that a finite cyclic group of birational
transformations of the plane is linearisable if and only if none of its
non-trivial elements fix a curve of positive genus. For finite Abelian groups,
there exists only one surprising exception, a group isomorphic to Z/2ZxZ/4Z,
whose non-trivial elements do not fix a curve of positive genus but which is
not conjugate to a group of automorphisms of a minimal rational surface.
  We also give some descriptions of automorphisms (not necessarily of finite
order) of del Pezzo surfaces and conic bundles.
"
2,123,"  Three types of integral representations for the cumulative distribution
functions of convolutions of non-central p-variate gamma distributions are
given by integration of elementary complex functions over the p-cube Cp =
(-pi,pi]x...x(-pi,pi]. In particular, the joint distribution of the diagonal
elements of a generalized quadratic form XAX' with n independent normally
distributed column vectors in X is obtained. For a single p-variate gamma
distribution function (p-1)-variate integrals over Cp-1 are derived. The
integrals are numerically more favourable than integrals obtained from the
Fourier or laplace inversion formula.
"
2,124,"  The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a
communication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their
respective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of the
senders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message
being transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has
advantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding,
is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme,
achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian
cases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate
regions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the
high-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer
considerable improvements over these existing results.
"
2,125,"  A subset $X$ of an abelian $G$ is said to be {\em complete} if every element
of the subgroup generated by $X$ can be expressed as a nonempty sum of distinct
elements from $X$.
  Let $A\subset \Z_n$ be such that all the elements of $A$ are coprime with
$n$. Solving a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Heilbronn, Olson proved that
  $A$ is complete if $n$ is a prime and if $|A|>2\sqrt{n}.$
  Recently Vu proved that there is an absolute constant $c$, such that for an
arbitrary large $n$, $A$ is complete if $|A|\ge c\sqrt{n},$ and conjectured
that 2 is essentially the right value of $c$. We show that $A$ is complete if
$|A|> 1+2\sqrt{n-4}$, thus proving the last conjecture.
"
2,126,"  A solution is given to the following problem: how to compute the
multiplicity, or more generally the Hilbert function, at a point on a Schubert
variety in an orthogonal Grassmannian. Standard monomial theory is applied to
translate the problem from geometry to combinatorics. The solution of the
resulting combinatorial problem forms the bulk of the paper. This approach has
been followed earlier to solve the same problem for the Grassmannian and the
symplectic Grassmannian.
  As an application, we present an interpretation of the multiplicity as the
number of non-intersecting lattice paths of a certain kind.
  Taking the Schubert variety to be of a special kind and the point to be the
""identity coset,"" our problem specializes to a problem about Pfaffian ideals
treatments of which by different methods exist in the literature. Also
available in the literature is a geometric solution when the point is a
""generic singularity.""
"
2,127,"  Erd\""{o}s and Tur\'{a}n once conjectured that any set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$
with $\sum_{a\in A}{1}/{a}=\infty$ should contain infinitely many progressions
of arbitrary length $k\geq3$. For the two-dimensional case Graham conjectured
that if $B\subset \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $$\sum\limits_{(x,y)\in
B}\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}=\infty,$$ then for any $s\geq2$, $B$ contains an $s\times
s$ axes-parallel grid. In this paper it is shown that if the Graham conjecture
is true for some $s\geq2$, then the Erd\""{o}s-Tur\'{a}n conjecture is true for
$k=2s-1$.
"
2,128,"  Let $(A,\Theta)$ be a principally polarised abelian variety, and let Y be a
subvariety. Pareschi and Popa conjectured that Y has minimal cohomology class
if and only if the structure sheaf of Y satisfies a property that they call
M-regularity.
  Let now X be a smooth cubic threefold. By a classical result due to Clemens
and Griffiths, its intermediate Jacobian J(X) is a principally polarised
abelian variety; furthermore the Fano surface of lines on X can be embedded in
J(X) and has minimal cohomology class. In this short note we show that its
structure sheaf is M-regular.
"
2,129,"  The spectral action on noncommutative torus is obtained, using a
Chamseddine--Connes formula via computations of zeta functions. The importance
of a Diophantine condition is outlined. Several results on holomorphic
continuation of series of holomorphic functions are obtained in this context.
"
2,130,"  We rigorously derive a weak form of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner equation as
the homogenization limit of a Stefan-type problem describing
reaction-controlled coarsening of a large number of small spherical particles.
Moreover, we deduce that the effective mean-field description holds true in the
particular limit of vanishing surface-area density of particles.
"
2,131,"  We introduce a new class of canonical AZD's (called the supercanonical AZD's)
on the canonical bundles of smooth projective varieties with pseudoeffective
canonical classes. We study the variation of the supercanonical AZD
$\hat{h}_{can}$ under projective deformations and give a new proof of the
invariance of plurigenera.
"
2,132,"  We consider a model for interest rates, where the short rate is given by a
time-homogenous, one-dimensional affine process in the sense of Duffie,
Filipovic and Schachermayer. We show that in such a model yield curves can only
be normal, inverse or humped (i.e. endowed with a single local maximum). Each
case can be characterized by simple conditions on the present short rate. We
give conditions under which the short rate process will converge to a limit
distribution and describe the limit distribution in terms of its cumulant
generating function. We apply our results to the Vasicek model, the CIR model,
a CIR model with added jumps and a model of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.
"
2,133,"  Let $G$ be a finite group and $V$ be a finite $G$--module. We present upper
bounds for the cardinalities of certain subsets of $\Irr(GV)$, such as the set
of those $\chi\in\Irr(GV)$ such that, for a fixed $v\in V$, the restriction of
$\chi$ to $<v>$ is not a multiple of the regular character of $<v>$. These
results might be useful in attacking the non--coprime $k(GV)$--problem.
"
2,134,"  We consider statistical mechanics models of continuous height effective
interfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. There is a
detailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions
without disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs
measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force
and diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.
  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify
this transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to
beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause
delocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap
between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2
dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to
localization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that
in higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the
pinning force tends to infinity.
"
2,135,"  Let $\Dh$ and $A$ be unital and separable $C^{*}$-algebras; let $\Dh$ be
strongly self-absorbing. It is known that any two unital $^*$-homomorphisms
from $\Dh$ to $A \otimes \Dh$ are approximately unitarily equivalent. We show
that, if $\Dh$ is also $K_{1}$-injective, they are even asymptotically
unitarily equivalent. This in particular implies that any unital endomorphism
of $\Dh$ is asymptotically inner. Moreover, the space of automorphisms of $\Dh$
is compactly-contractible (in the point-norm topology) in the sense that for
any compact Hausdorff space $X$, the set of homotopy classes $[X,\Aut(\Dh)]$
reduces to a point. The respective statement holds for the space of unital
endomorphisms of $\Dh$. As an application, we give a description of the
Kasparov group $KK(\Dh, A\ot \Dh)$ in terms of $^*$-homomorphisms and
asymptotic unitary equivalence. Along the way, we show that the Kasparov group
$KK(\Dh, A\ot \Dh)$ is isomorphic to $K_0(A\ot \Dh)$.
"
2,136,"  A new expression as a certain asymptotic limit via ""discrete micro-states"" of
permutations is provided to the mutual information of both continuous and
discrete random variables.
"
2,137,"  We present an algorithm for systematic encoding of Hermitian codes. For a
Hermitian code defined over GF(q^2), the proposed algorithm achieves a run time
complexity of O(q^2) and is suitable for VLSI implementation. The encoder
architecture uses as main blocks q varying-rate Reed-Solomon encoders and
achieves a space complexity of O(q^2) in terms of finite field multipliers and
memory elements.
"
2,138,"  We consider the curvature of a family of warped products of two
pseduo-Riemannian manifolds $(B,g_B)$ and $(F,g_F)$ furnished with metrics of
the form $c^{2}g_B \oplus w^2 g_F$ and, in particular, of the type $w^{2
\mu}g_B \oplus w^2 g_F$, where $c, w \colon B \to (0,\infty)$ are smooth
functions and $\mu$ is a real parameter. We obtain suitable expressions for the
Ricci tensor and scalar curvature of such products that allow us to establish
results about the existence of Einstein or constant scalar curvature structures
in these categories. If $(B,g_B)$ is Riemannian, the latter question involves
nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations with concave-convex
nonlinearities and singular partial differential equations of the
Lichnerowicz-York type among others.
"
2,139,"  This is a final step in a local classification of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
with parallel Weyl tensor that are not conformally flat or locally symmetric.
"
2,140,"  We introduce a new class of ""random"" subsets of natural numbers, WM sets.
This class contains normal sets (sets whose characteristic function is a normal
binary sequence). We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for
solvability of systems of linear equations within every WM set and within every
normal set. We also show that partition-regular system of linear equations with
integer coefficients is solvable in any WM set.
"
2,141,"  We study birational maps with empty base locus defined by almost complete
intersection ideals. Birationality is shown to be expressed by the equality of
two Chern numbers. We provide a relatively effective method of their
calculation in terms of certain Hilbert coefficients. In dimension two the
structure of the irreducible ideals leads naturally to the calculation of
Sylvester determinants via a computer-assisted method. For degree at most 5 we
produce the full set of defining equations of the base ideal. The results
answer affirmatively some questions raised by D. Cox.
"
2,142,"  We prove an Alexander type theorem for the spectral unit ball $\Omega_n$
showing that there are no non-trivial proper holomorphic mappings in
$\Omega_n$, $n\geq 2$.
"
2,143,"  Consider the family S of irreducible plane curves of degree n with d nodes
and k cusps as singularities. Let W be an irreducible component of S. We
consider the natural rational map from W to the moduli space of curves of genus
g=(n-1)(n-2)/2-d-k. We define the ""number of moduli of W"" as the dimension of
the image of W with respect to this map. If W has the expected dimension equal
to 3n+g-1-k, then the number of moduli of W is at most equal to the min(3g-3,
3g-3+\rho-k), dove \rho is the Brill-Neother number of the linear series of
degree n and dimension 2 on a smooth curve of genus g. We say that W has the
expected number of moduli if the equality holds. In this paper we construct
examples of families of irreducible plane curves with nodes and cusps as
singularities having expected number of moduli and with non-positive
Brill-Noether number.
"
2,144,"  If $\mu$ is a finite complex measure in the complex plane $\C$ we denote by
$C^\mu$ its Cauchy integral defined in the sense of principal value. The
measure $\mu$ is called reflectionless if it is continuous (has no atoms) and
$C^\mu=0$ at $\mu$-almost every point. We show that if $\mu$ is reflectionless
and its Cauchy maximal function $C^\mu_*$ is summable with respect to $|\mu|$
then $\mu$ is trivial. An example of a reflectionless measure whose maximal
function belongs to the ""weak"" $L^1$ is also constructed, proving that the
above result is sharp in its scale. We also give a partial geometric
description of the set of reflectionless measures on the line and discuss
connections of our results with the notion of sets of finite perimeter in the
sense of De Giorgi.
"
2,145,"  Let S be the variety of irreducible sextics with six cusps as singularities.
Let W be one of irreducible components of W. Denoting by M_4 the space of
moduli of smooth curves of genus 4, the moduli map of W is the rational map
from W to M_4 sending the general point of W, corresponding to a plane curve D,
to the point of M_4 parametrizing the normalization curve of D. The number of
moduli of W is, by definition the dimension of the image of W with respect to
the moduli map. We know that this number is at most equal to seven. In this
paper we prove that both irreducible components of S have number of moduli
exactly equal to seven.
"
2,146,"  We construct several difference families on cyclic groups of orders 47 and
97, and use them to construct skew-Hadamard matrices of orders 188 and 388.
Such difference families and matrices are constructed here for the first time.
The matrices are constructed by using the Goethals-Seidel array.
"
2,147,"  A celebrated result of F. Jaeger states that the Tutte polynomial of a planar
graph is determined by the HOMFLY polynomial of an associated link. Here we are
interested in the converse of this result. We consider the question `to what
extent does the Tutte polynomial determine the HOMFLY polynomial of any knot?'
We show that the HOMFLY polynomial of a knot is determined by Tutte polynomials
of plane graphs associated to the knot.
"
2,148,"  We study quivers with relations given by non-commutative analogs of Jacobian
ideals in the complete path algebra. This framework allows us to give a
representation-theoretic interpretation of quiver mutations at arbitrary
vertices. This gives a far-reaching generalization of
Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection functors. The motivations for this work
come from several sources: superpotentials in physics, Calabi-Yau algebras,
cluster algebras.
"
2,149,"  We study more general variational problems on time scales. Previous results
are generalized by proving necessary optimality conditions for (i) variational
problems involving delta derivatives of more than the first order, and (ii)
problems of the calculus of variations with delta-differential side conditions
(Lagrange problem of the calculus of variations on time scales).
"
2,150,"  Under some positivity assumptions, extension properties of rationally
connected fibrations from a submanifold to its ambient variety are studied.
Given a family of rational curves on a complex projective manifold X inducing a
covering family on a submanifold Y with ample normal bundle in X, the main
results relate, under suitable conditions, the associated rational connected
fiber structures on X and on Y. Applications of these results include an
extension theorem for Mori contractions of fiber type and a classification
theorem in the case Y has a structure of projective bundle or quadric
fibration.
"
2,151,"  Let $\Goo$ be a semisimple real Lie group with unitary dual $\Ghat$. The goal
of this note is to produce new upper bounds for the multiplicities with which
representations $\pi \in \Ghat$ of cohomological type appear in certain spaces
of cusp forms on $\Goo$.
"
2,152,"  We consider the defocusing, $\dot{H}^1$-critical Hartree equation for the
radial data in all dimensions $(n\geq 5)$. We show the global well-posedness
and scattering results in the energy space. The new ingredient in this paper is
that we first take advantage of the term $\displaystyle - \int_{I}\int_{|x|\leq
A|I|^{1/2}}|u|^{2}\Delta \Big(\frac{1}{|x|}\Big)dxdt$ in the localized Morawetz
identity to rule out the possibility of energy concentration, instead of the
classical Morawetz estimate dependent of the nonlinearity.
"
2,153,"  The notion of topological free entropy dimension of $n-$tuples of elements in
a unital C$^*$ algebra was introduced by Voiculescu. In the paper, we compute
topological free entropy dimension of one self-adjoint element and topological
orbit dimension of one self-adjoint element in a unital C$^*$ algebra.
Moreover, we calculate the values of topological free entropy dimensions of
families of generators of some unital C$^*$ algebras (for example: irrational
rotation C$^*$ algebras or minimal tensor product of two reduced C$^*$ algebras
of free groups).
"
2,154,"  We give an extended review of recent work on the extended weak coupling
limit. Background material on completely positive semigroups and their unitary
dilations is given, as well as a particularly easy construction of `quadratic
noises'.
"
2,155,"  The problem of statistical learning is to construct a predictor of a random
variable $Y$ as a function of a related random variable $X$ on the basis of an
i.i.d. training sample from the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$. Allowable
predictors are drawn from some specified class, and the goal is to approach
asymptotically the performance (expected loss) of the best predictor in the
class. We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the
$X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at some
finite bit rate. The encoding of the $Y$-values is allowed to depend on the
$X$-values. Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,
the underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we
give an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor
performance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas are
illustrated on the example of nonparametric regression in Gaussian noise.
"
2,156,"  Every finite branch solutions to the sixth Painleve equation around a fixed
singular point is an algebraic branch solution. In particular a global solution
is an algebraic solution if and only if it is finitely many-valued globally.
The proof of this result relies on algebraic geometry of Painleve VI,
Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, geometry and dynamics on cubic surfaces,
resolutions of Kleinian singularities, and power geometry of algebraic
differential equations. In the course of the proof we are also able to classify
all finite branch solutions up to Backlund transformations.
"
2,157,"  In this paper we give a generalization of Chebyshev polynomials and using
this we describe the M\""obius function of the generalized subword order from a
poset {a1,...as,c |ai<c}, which contains an affirmative answer for the
conjecture by Bj\""orner, Sagan, Vatter.[5,10]
"
2,158,"  This paper is devoted to describe the finite-dimensionality of a
two-dimensional micropolar fluid flow with periodic boundary conditions. We
define the notions of determining modes and nodes and estimate the number of
them, we also estimate the dimension of the global attractor. Finally we
compare our results with analogous results for Navier-Stokes equation.
"
2,159,"  The rotor-router model is a deterministic analogue of random walk. It can be
used to define a deterministic growth model analogous to internal DLA. We prove
that the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which
is stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\omega_d r^d$
sites, where $\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\R^d$, we show that
the inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\log r)$, while the
outradius is at most $r+O(r^\alpha)$ for any $\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related
model, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a
Euclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total
mass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\pi
r^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\sqrt{3}$, and the
outradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne
and Rossin. Similar bounds apply in higher dimensions.
"
2,160,"  We study a heavy piston of mass $M$ that moves in one dimension. The piston
separates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unit
mass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\geq 1$. Using averaging
techniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in
probability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $
when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and
the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed
out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.
  When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that
the rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged
behavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The
convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also
investigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been
smoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,
both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.
  In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons
separating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of
averaging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging
results. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem
for smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.
"
2,161,"  We construct a new random probability measure on the sphere and on the unit
interval which in both cases has a Gibbs structure with the relative entropy
functional as Hamiltonian. It satisfies a quasi-invariance formula with respect
to the action of smooth diffeomorphism of the sphere and the interval
respectively. The associated integration by parts formula is used to construct
two classes of diffusion processes on probability measures (on the sphere or
the unit interval) by Dirichlet form methods. The first one is closely related
to Malliavin's Brownian motion on the homeomorphism group. The second one is a
probability valued stochastic perturbation of the heat flow, whose intrinsic
metric is the quadratic Wasserstein distance. It may be regarded as the
canonical diffusion process on the Wasserstein space.
"
2,162,"  This paper is devoted to the analysis of a second order method for recovering
the \emph{a priori} unknown shape of an inclusion $\omega$ inside a body
$\Omega$ from boundary measurement. This inverse problem - known as electrical
impedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has
focussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,
no work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper
aims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative
of the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface
$\partial\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the
geometry of $\partial \omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives
needed to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the
stability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely
ill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.
"
2,163,"  We consider maximum solution $g(t)$, $t\in [0, +\infty)$, to the normalized
Ricci flow. Among other things, we prove that, if $(M, \omega) $ is a smooth
compact symplectic 4-manifold such that $b_2^+(M)>1$ and let
$g(t),t\in[0,\infty)$, be a solution to (1.3) on $M$ whose Ricci curvature
satisfies that $|\text{Ric}(g(t))|\leq 3$ and additionally $\chi(M)=3 \tau
(M)>0$, then there exists an $m\in \mathbb{N}$, and a sequence of points
$\{x_{j,k}\in M\}$, $j=1, ..., m$, satisfying that, by passing to a
subsequence, $$(M, g(t_{k}+t), x_{1,k},..., x_{m,k})
\stackrel{d_{GH}}\longrightarrow (\coprod_{j=1}^m N_j, g_{\infty},
x_{1,\infty}, ...,, x_{m,\infty}),$$ $t\in [0, \infty)$, in the $m$-pointed
Gromov-Hausdorff sense for any sequence $t_{k}\longrightarrow \infty$, where
$(N_{j}, g_{\infty})$, $j=1,..., m$, are complete complex hyperbolic orbifolds
of complex dimension 2 with at most finitely many isolated orbifold points.
Moreover, the convergence is $C^{\infty}$ in the non-singular part of
$\coprod_1^m N_{j}$ and
$\text{Vol}_{g_{0}}(M)=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\text{Vol}_{g_{\infty}}(N_{j})$, where
$\chi(M)$ (resp. $\tau(M)$) is the Euler characteristic (resp. signature) of
$M$.
"
2,164,"  We discuss the asymptotic behaviour of models of lattice polygons, mainly on
the square lattice. In particular, we focus on limiting area laws in the
uniform perimeter ensemble where, for fixed perimeter, each polygon of a given
area occurs with the same probability. We relate limit distributions to the
scaling behaviour of the associated perimeter and area generating functions,
thereby providing a geometric interpretation of scaling functions. To a major
extent, this article is a pedagogic review of known results.
"
2,165,"  We present a Lohner type algorithm for the computation of rigorous bounds for
solutions of ordinary differential equations and its derivatives with respect
to initial conditions up to arbitrary order. As an application we prove the
existence of multiple invariant tori around some elliptic periodic orbits for
the pendulum equation with periodic forcing and for Michelson system.
"
2,166,"  In this paper, the notion of {\em $p$-adic multiresolution analysis (MRA)} is
introduced. We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a
refinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This
equation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is
the sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.
The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real
Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function
generating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real
refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different
2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar
MRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential
operators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be
intensively used for applications.
"
2,167,"  We compute the loss of power in likelihood ratio tests when we test the
original parameter of a probability density extended by the first Lehmann
alternative.
"
2,168,"  We apply results of Malliavin-Thalmaier-Watanabe for strong and weak Taylor
expansions of solutions of perturbed stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
In particular, we work out weight expressions for the Taylor coefficients of
the expansion. The results are applied to LIBOR market models in order to deal
with the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility. In contrast
to other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full SDE, we obtain
easily tractable expressions for accurate pricing. In particular, we present an
easily tractable alternative to ``freezing the drift'' in LIBOR market models,
which has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme. Numerical examples
underline the results.
"
2,169,"  In this paper we consider successive iterations of the first-order
differential operations in space ${\bf R}^3.$
"
2,170,"  In this paper we present a recurrent relation for counting meaningful
compositions of the higher-order differential operations on the space $R^{n}$
(n=3,4,...) and extract the non-trivial compositions of order higher than two.
"
2,171,"  We provide several equivalent characterizations of Kobayashi hyperbolicity in
unbounded convex domains in terms of peak and anti-peak functions at infinity,
affine lines, Bergman metric and iteration theory.
"
2,172,"  We give a new procedure in Maple for finding the k-th power of a martix. The
algorithm is based on the article [1].
"
2,173,"  Onsager conjectured that weak solutions of the Euler equations for
incompressible fluids in 3D conserve energy only if they have a certain minimal
smoothness, (of order of 1/3 fractional derivatives) and that they dissipate
energy if they are rougher. In this paper we prove that energy is conserved for
velocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$. We show that this space
is sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the
Littlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled by
local interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux;
moreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to
$B^{2/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$ conserves helicity. In contrast, in two dimensions, the
strong locality of the enstrophy holds only in the ultraviolet range.
"
2,174,"  We introduce a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the
velocity and pressure are both piecewise constant (colocated scheme). We use a
projection (fractional-step) method to deal with the incompressibility
constraint. We prove that the differential operators in the Navier-Stokes
equations and their discrete counterparts share similar properties. In
particular, we state an inf-sup (Babuska-Brezzi) condition. We infer from it
the stability of the scheme.
"
2,175,"  Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. An \emph{$n$-potent} is an element $e$ of a
ring $R$ such that $e^n = e$. In this paper, we study $n$-potents in matrices
over $R$ and use them to construct an abelian group $K_0^n(R)$. If $A$ is a
complex algebra, there is a group isomorphism $K_0^n(A) \cong
\bigl(K_0(A)\bigr)^{n-1}$ for all $n \geq 2$. However, for algebras over
cyclotomic fields, this is not true in general. We consider $K_0^n$ as a
covariant functor, and show that it is also functorial for a generalization of
homomorphism called an \emph{$n$-homomorphism}.
"
2,176,"  Let $X$ be an equivariant embedding of a connected reductive group $G$ over
an algebraically closed field $k$ of positive characteristic. Let $B$ denote a
Borel subgroup of $G$. A $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ is a subvariety of the
form $\diag(G) \cdot V$, where $V$ is a $B \times B$-orbit closure in $X$. In
the case where $X$ is the wonderful compactification of a group of adjoint
type, the $G$-Schubert varieties are the closures of Lusztig's $G$-stable
pieces. We prove that $X$ admits a Frobenius splitting which is compatible with
all $G$-Schubert varieties. Moreover, when $X$ is smooth, projective and
toroidal, then any $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ admits a stable Frobenius
splitting along an ample divisors. Although this indicates that $G$-Schubert
varieties have nice singularities we present an example of a non-normal
$G$-Schubert variety in the wonderful compactification of a group of type
$G_2$. Finally we also extend the Frobenius splitting results to the more
general class of $\mathcal R$-Schubert varieties.
"
2,177,"  We introduce a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the
velocity and pressure are respectively piecewise constant and affine. We use a
projection method to deal with the incompressibility constraint. We show that
the differential operators in the Navier-Stokes equations and their discrete
counterparts share similar properties. In particular we state an inf-sup
(Babuska-Brezzi) condition. Using these properties we infer the stability of
the scheme.
"
2,178,"  We consider a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the
velocity and pressure are respectively piecewise constant and affine. We use a
projection method to deal with the incompressibility constraint. In a former
paper, the stability of the scheme has been proven. We infer from it its
convergence.
"
2,179,"  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that
recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density
matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability
distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure
state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple
generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a
quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,
the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit
trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent
relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under
contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.
As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we
consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process
Schr\""odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace
formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian
motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov
master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies
generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett
master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast
stochastic Schr\""odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state
vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment
behaves like the latter.
"
2,180,"  In a 2002 paper, the authors and Bruner used the new spectrum tmf to obtain
some new nonimmersions of real projective spaces. In this note, we
complete/correct two oversights in that paper.
  The first is to note that in that paper a general nonimmersion result was
stated which yielded new nonimmersions for RP^n with n as small as 48, and yet
it was stated there that the first new result occurred when n=1536. Here we
give a simple proof of those overlooked results.
  Secondly, we fill in a gap in the proof of the 2002 paper. There it was
claimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recently
that this is not clear. However, here we show that it is true up multiplication
by a unit in the appropriate ring, and so we retrieve all the nonimmersion
results claimed in the original paper.
  Finally, we present a complete determination of tmf^{8*}(RP^\infty\times
RP^\infty) and tmf^*(CP^\infty\times CP^\infty) in positive dimensions.
"
2,181,"  We compute temperate fundamental solutions of homogeneous differential
operators with real-principal type symbols. Via analytic continuation of
meromorphic distributions, fundamental solutions for these non-elliptic
operators can be constructed in terms of radial averages and invariant
distributions on the unit sphere.
"
2,182,"  This paper develops a contention-based opportunistic feedback technique
towards relay selection in a dense wireless network. This technique enables the
forwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to the
destination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such as
the feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage of
the proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a
distributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match that
of centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposed
method. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughput
gains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.
"
2,183,"  It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on
opportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in
dense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ
transmission approach where relays forward parity information to the
destination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,
suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the
best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by
adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection
problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is
necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying
key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold
is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the
importance of relay selection.
"
2,184,"  Let $ v$ be a smooth vector field on the plane, that is a map from the plane
to the unit circle. We study sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the
Hilbert transform
  \operatorname H_{v, \epsilon}f(x) := \text{p.v.}\int_{-\epsilon}^ \epsilon
f(x-yv(x)) \frac{dy}y where $ \epsilon $ is a suitably chosen parameter,
determined by the smoothness properties of the vector field. It is a
conjecture, due to E.\thinspace M.\thinspace Stein, that if $ v$ is Lipschitz,
there is a positive $ \epsilon $ for which the transform above is bounded on $
L ^{2}$. Our principal result gives a sufficient condition in terms of the
boundedness of a maximal function associated to $ v$. This sufficient condition
is that this new maximal function be bounded on some $ L ^{p}$, for some $
1<p<2$. We show that the maximal function is bounded from $ L ^{2}$ to weak $ L
^{2}$ for all Lipschitz maximal function. The relationship between our results
and other known sufficient conditions is explored.
"
2,185,"  We report on some recent results concerning the dynamics of Bose-Einstein
condensates, obtained in a series of joint papers with L. Erdos and H.-T. Yau.
Starting from many body quantum dynamics, we present a rigorous derivation of a
cubic nonlinear Schroedinger equation known as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
for the time evolution of the condensate wave function.
"
2,186,"  The classical Littlewood-Richardson coefficients C(lambda,mu,nu) carry a
natural $S_3$ symmetry via permutation of the indices. Our ""carton rule"" for
computing these numbers transparently and uniformly explains these six
symmetries; previously formulated Littlewood-Richardson rules manifest at most
three of the six.
"
2,187,"  Deformations of the 3-differential of 3-differential graded algebras are
controlled by the (3,N) Maurer-Cartan equation. We find explicit formulae for
the coefficients appearing in that equation, introduce new geometric examples
of N-differential graded algebras, and use these results to study N Lie
algebroids.
"
2,188,"  We assess the practicality of random network coding by illuminating the issue
of overhead and considering it in conjunction with increasingly long packets
sent over the erasure channel. We show that the transmission of increasingly
long packets, consisting of either of an increasing number of symbols per
packet or an increasing symbol alphabet size, results in a data rate
approaching zero over the erasure channel. This result is due to an erasure
probability that increases with packet length. Numerical results for a
particular modulation scheme demonstrate a data rate of approximately zero for
a large, but finite-length packet. Our results suggest a reduction in the
performance gains offered by random network coding.
"
2,189,"  By using tools of time-frequency analysis, we obtain some improved local
well-posedness results for the NLS, NLW and NLKG equations with Cauchy data in
modulation spaces $M{p, 1}_{0,s}$.
"
2,190,"  A new Z-basis for the space of quasisymmetric functions (QSym, for short) is
presented. It is shown to have nonnegative structure constants, and several
interesting properties relative to the space of quasisymmetric functions
associated to matroids by the Hopf algebra morphism (F) of Billera, Jia, and
Reiner. In particular, for loopless matroids, this basis reflects the grading
by matroid rank, as well as by the size of the ground set. It is shown that the
morphism F is injective on the set of rank two matroids, and that
decomposability of the quasisymmetric function of a rank two matroid mirrors
the decomposability of its base polytope. An affirmative answer is given to the
Hilbert basis question raised by Billera, Jia, and Reiner.
"
2,191,"  We study universal compression of sequences generated by monotonic
distributions. We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet of
size $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \log (n/k^3)$ bits,
where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,
for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$
bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic
distributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of
$O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains
fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and
geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions
over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a
method to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.
The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.
Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence
is governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose
empirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to
those in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in
the empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual
sequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood
description length may still be achievable.
"
2,192,"  This note is devoted to the definition of moduli spaces of rational tropical
curves with n marked points. We show that this space has a structure of a
smooth tropical variety of dimension n-3. We define the Deligne-Mumford
compactification of this space and tropical $\psi$-class divisors.
"
2,193,"  For k a field of arbitrary characteristic, and R a k-algebra, we show that
the PI degree of an iterated skew polynomial ring
R[x_1;\tau_1,\delta_1]...b[x_n;\tau_n,\delta_n] agrees with the PI degree of
R[x_1;\tau_1]...b[x_n;\tau_n] when each (\tau_i,\delta_i) satisfies a q_i-skew
relation for q_i \in k^{\times} and extends to a higher q_i-skew
\tau_i-derivation. We confirm the quantum Gel'fand-Kirillov conjecture for
various quantized coordinate rings, and calculate their PI degrees. We extend
these results to completely prime factor algebras.
"
2,194,"  A local growth algorithm for a decagonal quasicrystal is presented. We show
that a perfect Penrose tiling (PPT) layer can be grown on a decapod tiling
layer by a three dimensional (3D) local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins to
form on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resulting
in a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defect
only on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an ideal
quasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D,
contrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.
"
2,195,"  In the first section of this paper we prove a theorem for the number of
columns of a rectangular area that are identical to the given one. In the next
section we apply this theorem to derive several combinatorial identities by
counting specified subsets of a finite set.
"
2,196,"  This paper studies normalized Ricci flow on a nonparabolic surface, whose
scalar curvature is asymptotically -1 in an integral sense. By a method
initiated by R. Hamilton, the flow is shown to converge to a metric of constant
scalar curvature -1. A relative estimate of Green's function is proved as a
tool.
"
2,197,"  We study the relationship between transfinite diameter, Chebyshev constant
and Wiener energy in the abstract linear potential analytic setting pioneered
by Choquet, Fuglede and Ohtsuka. It turns out that, whenever the potential
theoretic kernel has the maximum principle, then all these quantities are equal
for all compact sets. For continuous kernels even the converse statement is
true: if the Chebyshev constant of any compact set coincides with its
transfinite diameter, the kernel must satisfy the maximum principle. An
abundance of examples is provided to show the sharpness of the results.
"
2,198,"  Let $X$ be a compact K\""ahler manifold and $\om$ a smooth closed form of
bidegree $(1,1)$ which is nonnegative and big. We study the classes ${\mathcal
E}_{\chi}(X,\om)$ of $\om$-plurisubharmonic functions of finite weighted
Monge-Amp\`ere energy. When the weight $\chi$ has fast growth at infinity, the
corresponding functions are close to be bounded.
  We show that if a positive Radon measure is suitably dominated by the
Monge-Amp\`ere capacity, then it belongs to the range of the Monge-Amp\`ere
operator on some class ${\mathcal E}_{\chi}(X,\om)$. This is done by
establishing a priori estimates on the capacity of sublevel sets of the
solutions.
  Our result extends U.Cegrell's and S.Kolodziej's results and puts them into a
unifying frame. It also gives a simple proof of S.T.Yau's celebrated a priori
${\mathcal C}^0$-estimate.
"
2,199,"  We fully elucidate the structure of the hierarchy of the connected operators
that commute with the Markov matrix of the Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process
(TASEP). We prove for the connected operators a combinatorial formula that was
conjectured in a previous work. Our derivation is purely algebraic and relies
on the algebra generated by the local jump operators involved in the TASEP.

"
2,200,"  We give general spectral and eigenvalue perturbation bounds for a selfadjoint
operator perturbed in the sense of the pseudo-Friedrichs extension. We also
give several generalisations of the aforementioned extension. The spectral
bounds for finite eigenvalues are obtained by using analyticity and
monotonicity properties (rather than variational principles) and they are
general enough to include eigenvalues in gaps of the essential spectrum.
"
2,201,"  For a smooth projective curve, the cycles of e-secant k-planes are among the
most studied objects in classical enumerative geometry and there are well-known
formulas due to Castelnuovo, Cayley and MacDonald concerning them. Despite
various attempts, surprisingly little is known about the enumerative validity
of such formulas. The aim of this paper is to completely clarify this problem
in the case of the generic curve C of given genus. Using degeneration
techniques and a few facts about the birational geometry of moduli spaces of
stable pointed curves we determine precisely under which conditions the cycle
of e-secant k-planes in non-empty and we compute its dimension. We also
precisely determine the dimension of the variety of linear series on C carrying
e-secant k-planes. In a different direction, in the last part of the paper we
study the distribution of ramification points of the powers of a line bundle on
C having prescribed ramification at a given point.
"
2,202,"  In this work initial numbers and repunit numbers have been studied. All
numbers have been considered in a decimal notation. The problem of simplicity
of initial numbers has been studied. Interesting properties of numbers repunit
are proved:
  $gcd(R_a, R_b) = R_{gcd(a,b)}$;
  $R_{ab}/(R_aR_b)$ is an integer only if $gcd(a,b) = 1$, where $a\geq1$,
$b\geq1$ are integers. Dividers of numbers repunit, are researched by a degree
of prime number.
"
2,203,"  We give an easy counter-example to Problem 7.20 from C. Villani's book on
mass transport: in general, the quadratic Wasserstein distance between $n$-fold
normalized convolutions of two given measures fails to decrease monotonically.
"
2,204,"  We first exhibit counterexamples to some open questions related to a theorem
of Sakai.
  Then we establish an extension theorem of Sakai type for separately
holomorphic/meromorphic functions.
"
2,205,"  Uniform measures are defined as the functionals on the space of bounded
uniformly continuous functions that are continuous on bounded uniformly
equicontinuous sets. If every cardinal has measure zero then every countably
additive measure is a uniform measure. The functionals sequentially continuous
on bounded uniformly equicontinuous sets are exactly uniform measures on the
separable modification of the underlying uniform space.
"
2,206,"  In this article, we describe explicitely the Gorenstein locus of all
minuscule Schubert varieties. This proves a special case of a conjecture of A.
Woo and A. Yong (see math.AG/0603273) on the Gorenstein locus of Schubert
varieties.
"
2,207,"  We extend the theory of separately holomorphic mappings between complex
analytic spaces. Our method is based on Poletsky theory of discs, Rosay Theorem
on holomorphic discs and our recent joint-work with Pflug on cross theorems in
dimension 1. It also relies on our new technique of conformal mappings and a
generalization of Siciak's relative extremal function.
  Our approach illustrates the unified character: ``From local informations to
global extensions"". Moreover, it avoids systematically the use of the classical
method of doubly orthogonal bases of Bergman type.
"
2,208,"  In this paper we study the Metropolis algorithm in connection with two
mean--field spin systems, the so called mean--field Ising model and the
Blume--Emery--Griffiths model. In both this examples the naive choice of
proposal chain gives rise, for some parameters, to a slowly mixing Metropolis
chain, that is a chain whose spectral gap decreases exponentially fast (in the
dimension $N$ of the problem). Here we show how a slight variant in the
proposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational cost
similar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, with
a suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gap
which decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of the
energy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy level
of the starting state.
"
2,209,"  We define the secondary invariants L^2- eta and -rho forms for families of
generalized Dirac operators on normal coverings of fibre bundles. On the
covering family we assume transversally smooth spectral projections, and
Novikov--Shubin invariants bigger than 3(dim B+1) to treat the large time
asymptotic for general operators. In the particular case of a bundle of spin
manifolds, we study the L^2- rho class in relation to the space of positive
scalar curvature vertical metrics.
"
2,210,"  An n-homomorphism between algebras is a linear map $\phi : A \to B$ such that
$\phi(a_1 ... a_n) = \phi(a_1)... \phi(a_n)$ for all elements $a_1, >..., a_n
\in A.$ Every homomorphism is an n-homomorphism, for all n >= 2, but the
converse is false, in general. Hejazian et al. [7] ask: Is every *-preserving
n-homomorphism between C*-algebras continuous? We answer their question in the
affirmative, but the even and odd n arguments are surprisingly disjoint. We
then use these results to prove stronger ones: If n >2 is even, then $\phi$ is
just an ordinary *-homomorphism. If n >= 3 is odd, then $\phi$ is a difference
of two orthogonal *-homomorphisms. Thus, there are no nontrivial *-linear
n-homomorphisms between C*-algebras.
"
2,211,"  Cloaking devices are prescriptions of electrostatic, optical or
electromagnetic parameter fields (conductivity $\sigma(x)$, index of refraction
$n(x)$, or electric permittivity $\epsilon(x)$ and magnetic permeability
$\mu(x)$) which are piecewise smooth on $\mathbb R^3$ and singular on a
hypersurface $\Sigma$, and such that objects in the region enclosed by $\Sigma$
are not detectable to external observation by waves. Here, we give related
constructions of invisible tunnels, which allow electromagnetic waves to pass
between possibly distant points, but with only the ends of the tunnels visible
to electromagnetic imaging. Effectively, these change the topology of space
with respect to solutions of Maxwell's equations, corresponding to attaching a
handlebody to $\mathbb R^3$. The resulting devices thus function as
electromagnetic wormholes.
"
2,212,"  Conditional independence models in the Gaussian case are algebraic varieties
in the cone of positive definite covariance matrices. We study these varieties
in the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing the
recursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In the
case when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal of
the model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied by
graph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous with
respect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables.
This has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models.
Finally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classical
constructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of the
Grassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.
"
2,213,"  Yang's theorem forbids the process $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ in any Poincar\'{e}
invariant theory if photons are bosons and their two-particle states transform
under the Poincar\'{e} group in the standard way (under the standard coproduct
of the Poincar\'{e} group). This is an important result as it does not depend
on the assumptions of quantum field theory. Recent work on noncommutative
geometry requires deforming the above coproduct by the Drinfel'd twist. We
prove that $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ is forbidden for the twisted coproduct as well.
This result is also independent of the assumptions of quantum field theory. As
an illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that $Z^0
\to \nu + \nu$ is forbidden for the standard or twisted coproduct of the
Poincar\'{e} group if the neutrino is massless, even if lepton number is not
conserved. This is a special case of our general result that a massive particle
of spin $j$ cannot decay into two identical massless particles of the same
helicity if $j$ is odd, regardless of the coproduct used.
"
2,214,"  We prove a variation of Gronwall's lemma.
"
2,215,"  We investigate a one-parameter family of probability densities (related to
the Pareto distribution, which describes many natural phenomena) where the
Cramer-Rao inequality provides no information.
"
2,216,"  The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as the
conductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central
point of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of
eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for
many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test
functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all
one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same
distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.
We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction
terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from
excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and
depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the
explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing
sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier
coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect
to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for
example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic
curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order
biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank
over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several
families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,
depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced
torsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).
"
2,217,"  We investigate the incremental stability properties of It\^o stochastic
dynamical systems. Specifically, we derive a stochastic version of nonlinear
contraction theory that provides a bound on the mean square distance between
any two trajectories of a stochastically contracting system. This bound can be
expressed as a function of the noise intensity and the contraction rate of the
noise-free system. We illustrate these results in the contexts of stochastic
nonlinear observers design and stochastic synchronization.
"
2,218,"  Recently Conrey, Farmer and Zirnbauer conjectured formulas for the averages
over a family of ratios of products of shifted L-functions. Their L-functions
Ratios Conjecture predicts both the main and lower order terms for many
problems, ranging from n-level correlations and densities to mollifiers and
moments to vanishing at the central point. There are now many results showing
agreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory;
however, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known.
These terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, and
provide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios
Conjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. We
test a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic
family of quadratic Dirichlet characters arising from even fundamental
discriminants d \le X. For test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculate
all the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfect
agreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we show
agreement up to errors of size O(X^{-epsilon}) for any epsilon). Thus for this
family and suitably restricted test functions, we completely verify the Ratios
Conjecture's prediction for the 1-level density.
"
2,219,"  Triangular Lie algebras are the Lie algebras which can be faithfully
represented by triangular matrices of any finite size over the real/complex
number field. In the paper invariants ('generalized Casimir operators') are
found for three classes of Lie algebras, namely those which are either strictly
or non-strictly triangular, and for so-called special upper triangular Lie
algebras. Algebraic algorithm of [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2006, V.39, 5749;
math-ph/0602046], developed further in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor., 2007, V.40,
113; math-ph/0606045], is used to determine the invariants. A conjecture of [J.
Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2001, V.34, 9085], concerning the number of independent
invariants and their form, is corroborated.
"
2,220,"  The confinement problem has been solved in the anisotropic (2+1)-dimensional
SU(N) Yang-Mills theory at weak coupling. In this paper, we find the low-lying
spectrum for N=2. The lightest excitations are pairs of fundamental particles
of the (1+1)-dimensional SU(2)XSU(2) principal chiral sigma model bound in a
linear potential, with a specified matching condition where the particles
overlap. This matching condition can be determined from the exactly-known
S-matrix for the sigma model.
"
2,221,"  A polynomial skew product of C^2 is a map of the form f(z,w) = (p(z),
q(z,w)), where p and q are polynomials, such that f is regular of degree d >=
2. For polynomial maps of C, hyperbolicity is equivalent to the condition that
the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the Julia set; further,
critical points either iterate to an attracting cycle or infinity. For
polynomial skew products, Jonsson (Math. Ann., 1999) established that f is
Axiom A if and only if the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the
right analog of the Julia set. Here we present the analogous conclusion:
critical orbits either escape to infinity or accumulate on an attracting set.
In addition, we construct new examples of Axiom A maps demonstrating various
postcritical behaviors.
"
2,222,"  We study fragmentation trees of Gibbs type. In the binary case, we identify
the most general Gibbs-type fragmentation tree with Aldous' beta-splitting
model, which has an extended parameter range $\beta>-2$ with respect to the
${\rm beta}(\beta+1,\beta+1)$ probability distributions on which it is based.
In the multifurcating case, we show that Gibbs fragmentation trees are
associated with the two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet models for exchangeable
random partitions of $\mathbb {N}$, with an extended parameter range
$0\le\alpha\le1$, $\theta\ge-2\alpha$ and $\alpha<0$, $\theta =-m\alpha$, $m\in
\mathbb {N}$.
"
2,223,"  The study of problems of the calculus of variations with compositions is a
quite recent subject with origin in dynamical systems governed by chaotic maps.
Available results are reduced to a generalized Euler-Lagrange equation that
contains a new term involving inverse images of the minimizing trajectories. In
this work we prove a generalization of the necessary optimality condition of
DuBois-Reymond for variational problems with compositions. With the help of the
new obtained condition, a Noether-type theorem is proved. An application of our
main result is given to a problem appearing in the chaotic setting when one
consider maps that are ergodic.
"
2,224,"  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject
to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.
"
2,225,"  We study interacting systems of linear Brownian motions whose drift vector at
every time point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate
processes at that time. Our main objective has been to study the long range
behavior of the spacings between the Brownian motions arranged in increasing
order. For finitely many Brownian motions interacting in this manner, we
characterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is
tight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution given
by independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study one
particular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particle
gets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identically
distributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the dynamics of such a
process. Some related conjectures in this direction have also been discussed.
"
2,226,"  MIMO technology is one of the most significant advances in the past decade to
increase channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity
for mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each
node sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian
vector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper
coding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector
broadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental
result will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill
this gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in
the link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh
networks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging
non-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original
problem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the
transformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates
Lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method
based on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient
method. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network
performance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.
"
2,227,"  We study the Dirichlet problem associated to the equation for self-similar
surfaces for graphs over the Euclidean plane with a disk removed. We show the
existence of a solution provided the boundary conditions on the boundary circle
are small enough and satisfy some symmetries. This is the second step towards
the construction of new examples of complete embedded self similar surfaces
under mean curvature flow.
"
2,228,"  We prove that the set of limit groups is recursive, answering a question of
Delzant. One ingredient of the proof is the observation that a finitely
presented group with local retractions (a la Long and Reid) is coherent and,
furthermore, there exists an algorithm that computes presentations for finitely
generated subgroups. The other main ingredient is the ability to
algorithmically calculate centralizers in relatively hyperbolic groups.
Applications include the existence of recognition algorithms for limit groups
and free groups.
"
2,229,"  In this paper, we propose a direct solution method for optimal switching
problems of one-dimensional diffusions. This method is free from conjectures
about the form of the value function and switching strategies, or does not
require the proof of optimality through quasi-variational inequalities. The
direct method uses a general theory of optimal stopping problems for
one-dimensional diffusions and characterizes the value function as sets of the
smallest linear majorants in their respective transformed spaces.
"
2,230,"  We study the late-time behavior of spherically symmetric solutions of the
Yang-Mills equations on Minkowski and Schwarzschild backgrounds. Using
nonlinear perturbation theory we show in both cases that solutions having
smooth compactly supported initial data posses tails which decay as $t^{-4}$ at
timelike infinity. Moreover, for small initial data on Minkowski background we
derive the third-order formula for the amplitude of the tail and confirm
numerically its accuracy.
"
2,231,"  Any medium can be represented as an isometric subgraph of the hypercube, with
each token of the medium represented by a particular equivalence class of arcs
of the subgraph. Such a representation, although useful, is not especially
revealing of the structure of a particular medium. We propose an axiomatic
definition of the concept of a `mediatic graph'. We prove that the graph of any
medium is a mediatic graph. We also show that, for any non-necessarily finite
set S, there exists a bijection from the collection M of all the media on a
given set S (of states) onto the collection G of all the mediatic graphs on S.
"
2,232,"  Suppose that $h$ and $g$ belong to the algebra $\B$ generated by the rational
functions and an entire function $f$ of finite order on ${\Bbb C}^n$ and that
$h/g$ has algebraic polar variety. We show that either $h/g\in\B$ or
$f=q_1e^p+q_2$, where $p$ is a polynomial and $q_1,q_2$ are rational functions.
In the latter case, $h/g$ belongs to the algebra generated by the rational
functions, $e^p$ and $e^{-p}$.
"
2,233,"  Let F be a finite extension of Qp and G be GL(2,F). When V is the tensor
product of three admissible, irreducible, finite dimensional representations of
G, the space of G-invariant linear forms has dimension at most one. When a non
zero linear form exists, one wants to find an element of V which is not in its
kernel: this is a test vector. Gross and Prasad found explicit test vectors for
some triple of representations. In this paper, others are found, and they
almost complete the case when the conductor of each representation is at most
1.
"
2,234,"  We relate a generic character sheaf on a disconnected reductive group with a
character of a representation of the rational points of the group over a finite
field extending a result known in the connected case.
"
2,235,"  We propose a Hodge field theory construction that captures algebraic
properties of the reduction of Zwiebach invariants to Gromov-Witten invariants.
It generalizes the Barannikov-Kontsevich construction to the case of higher
genera correlators with gravitational descendants.
  We prove the main theorem stating that algebraically defined Hodge field
theory correlators satisfy all tautological relations. From this perspective
the statement that Barannikov-Kontsevich construction provides a solution of
the WDVV equation looks as the simplest particular case of our theorem. Also it
generalizes the particular cases of other low-genera tautological relations
proven in our earlier works; we replace the old technical proofs by a novel
conceptual proof.
"
2,236,"  Two ideas for the choice of an adequate set of coarse variables allowing
approximate autonomous dynamics for practical applications are presented. The
coarse variables are meant to represent averaged behavior of a fine-scale
autonomous dynamics.
"
2,237,"  We show that on Kahler manifolds with negative first Chern class, the
sequence of algebraic metrics introduced by H. Tsuji converges uniformly to the
Kahler-Einstein metric. For algebraic surfaces of general type and orbifolds
with isolated singularities, we prove a convergence result for a modified
version of Tsuji's iterative construction.
"
2,238,"  We prove that if d is an integer number bigger than 1 and f_1,...,f_d are
commuting circle diffeomorphisms respectively of class C^(1+\tau_k), where
\tau_1 + ... + \tau_k > 1, then these maps are simultaneously conjugate to
rotations provided that their rotation numbers are independent over the
rationals.
"
2,239,"  For an abelian category $A$ equipped with a torsion pair, we give an explicit
description for the abelian category $B$ introduced by Happel-Reiten-Smalo, and
also for the category of chain complexes $Ch(B)$ and the derived category
$D(B)$ of $B$. We also describe the DG structure on $Ch(B)$. As a consequence,
we find new proofs of certain results of Happel-Reiten-Smalo. The main
ingredient is the category of {\em decorated} complexes.
"
2,240,"  These notes are meant to provide a rapid introduction to triangulated
categories. We start with the definition of an additive category and end with a
glimps of tilting theory. Some exercises are included.
"
2,241,"  We introduce an explicit method for studying actions of a group stack G on an
algebraic stack X. As an example, we study in detail the case where
X=P(n_0,...,n_r) is a weighted projective stack over an arbitrary base S. To
this end, we give an explicit description of the group stack of automorphisms
of, the weighted projective general linear 2-group PGL(n_0,...,n_r). As an
application, we use a result of Colliot-Thelene to show that for every linear
algebraic group G over an arbitrary base field k (assumed to be reductive if
char(k)>0) such that Pic}(G)=0, every action of G on P(n_0,...,n_r) lifts to a
linear action of G on A^{r+1}.
"
2,242,"  To determine the stability and instability of a given steady galaxy
configuration is one of the fundamental problems in the Vlasov theory for
galaxy dynamics. In this article, we study the stability of isotropic spherical
symmetric galaxy models $f_{0}(E)$, for which the distribution function $f_{0}$
depends on the particle energy $E$ only. In the first part of the article, we
derive the first sufficient criterion for linear instability of $f_{0}(E):$
$f_{0}(E)$ is linearly unstable if the second-order operator \[
A_{0}\equiv-\Delta+4\pi\int f_{0}^{\prime}(E)\{I-\mathcal{P}\}dv \] has a
negative direction, where $\mathcal{P}$ is the projection onto the function
space $\{g(E,L)\},$ $L$ being the angular momentum [see the explicit formula
(\ref{A0-radial})]. In the second part of the article, we prove that for the
important King model, the corresponding $A_{0}$ is positive definite. Such a
positivity leads to the nonlinear stability of the King model under all
spherically symmetric perturbations.

2,243,"  A remark on a paper by Birkar-Cascini-Hacon-McKernan.
"
2,244,"  A simple application of the semipositivity.
"
2,245,"  We propose a new topological field theory on generalized complex geometry in
two dimension using AKSZ formulation. Zucchini's model is $A$ model in the case
that the generalized complex structuredepends on only a symplectic structure.
Our new model is $B$ model in the case that the generalized complex structure
depends on only a complex structure.
"
2,246,"  We give explicit formulae for the continuous Hochschild and cyclic homology
and cohomology of certain topological algebras. To this end we show that, for a
continuous morphism $\phi: \X\to \Y$ of complexes of complete nuclear
$DF$-spaces, the isomorphism of cohomology groups $H^n(\phi): H^n(\X) \to
H^n(\Y)$ is automatically topological. The continuous cyclic-type homology and
cohomology are described up to topological isomorphism for the following
classes of biprojective $\hat{\otimes}$-algebras: the tensor algebra $E
\hat{\otimes} F$ generated by the duality $(E, F, < \cdot, \cdot >)$ for
nuclear Fr\'echet spaces $E$ and $F$ or for nuclear $DF$-spaces $E$ and $F$;
nuclear biprojective K\""{o}the algebras $\lambda(P)$ which are Fr\'echet spaces
or $DF$-spaces; the algebra of distributions $\mathcal{E}^*(G)$ on a compact
Lie group $G$.
"
2,247,"  We prove curvature estimates for general curvature functions. As an
application we show the existence of closed, strictly convex hypersurfaces with
prescribed curvature $F$, where the defining cone of $F$ is $\C_+$. $F$ is only
assumed to be monotone, symmetric, homogeneous of degree 1, concave and of
class $C^{m,\al}$, $m\ge4$.
"
2,248,"  We consider a non-nestling random walk in a product random environment. We
assume an exponential moment for the step of the walk, uniformly in the
environment. We prove an invariance principle (functional central limit
theorem) under almost every environment for the centered and diffusively scaled
walk. The main point behind the invariance principle is that the quenched mean
of the walk behaves subdiffusively.
"
2,249,"  We find identities between theta constants with rational characteristics
evaluated at period matrix of $R,$ a cyclic 3 sheeted cover of the sphere with
$3k$ branch points $\lambda_1...\lambda_{3k}.$ These identities follow from
Thomae formula \cite{BR}. This formula expresses powers of theta constants as
polynomials in $\lambda_1...\lambda_{3k}.$ We apply the representation of the
symmetric group to find relations between the polynomials and hence between the
associated theta constants.
"
2,250,"  We compute the homotopy type of the space of T^n-equivariant symplectic
embeddings from the standard 2n-dimensional ball of some fixed radius into a
2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifold M, and use this computation to define
a Z-valued step function on the positive real line which is an invariant of the
symplectic-toric type of M. We conclude with a discussion of the partially
equivariant case of this result.
"
2,251,"  We define and solve the toric version of the symplectic ball packing problem,
in the sense of listing all 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds which
admit a perfect packing by balls embedded in a symplectic and torus equivariant
fashion.
  In order to do this we first describe a problem in geometric-combinatorics
which is equivalent to the toric symplectic ball packing problem. Then we solve
this problem using arguments from Convex Geometry and Delzant theory.
  Applications to symplectic blowing-up are also presented, and some further
questions are raised in the last section.
"
2,252,"  Let M be a symplectic-toric manifold of dimension at least four. This paper
investigates the so called symplectic ball packing problem in the toral
equivariant setting. We show that the set of toric symplectic ball packings of
M admits the structure of a convex polytope. Previous work of the first author
shows that up to equivalence, only CP^1 x CP^1 and CP^2 admit density one
packings when n=2 and only CP^n admits density one packings when n>2. In
contrast, we show that for a fixed n>=2 and each r in (0, 1), there are
uncountably many inequivalent 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds with a
maximal toric packing of density r. This result follows from a general analysis
of how the densities of maximal packings change while varying a given
symplectic-toric manifold through a family of symplectic-toric manifolds that
are equivariantly diffeomorphic but not equivariantly symplectomorphic.
"
2,253,"  We define Floer homology for a time-independent, or autonomous Hamiltonian on
a symplectic manifold with contact type boundary, under the assumption that its
1-periodic orbits are transversally nondegenerate. Our construction is based on
Morse-Bott techniques for Floer trajectories. Our main motivation is to
understand the relationship between linearized contact homology of a fillable
contact manifold and symplectic homology of its filling.
"
2,254,"  We study asymptotics of various Euclidean geometric phenomena as the
dimension tend to infinity.
"
2,255,"  A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the
shortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of
applicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a
particular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can
approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression
methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter,
for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an
empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable
definition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences.
Additionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found
across the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional
cellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.
"
2,256,"  We prove lower bound and finiteness properties for arakelovian heights with
respect to pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles. These heights were
introduced by Burgos, Kramer and K\""uhn, in their extension of the arithmetic
intersection theory of Gillet and Soul\'e, aimed to deal with hermitian vector
bundles equipped with metrics admitting suitable logarithmic singularities. Our
results generalize the corresponding properties for the heights of
Bost-Gillet-Soul\'e, as well as the properties established by Faltings for
heights of points attached to hermitian line bundles whose metrics have
logarithmic singularities. We also discuss various geometric constructions
where such pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles naturally arise.
"
2,257,"  We establish an equivalent condition to the validity of the Collatz
conjecture, using elementary methods. We derive some conclusions and show
several examples of our results. We also offer a variety of exercises, problems
and conjectures.
"
2,258,"  We give a new, elementary, purely analytical development of
\textsc{Descartes}' theorem that a smooth connected surface is a perfect
focusing lens if and only if it is a connected subset of the ovoid obtained by
revolving a cartesian oval around its axis of symmetry.
"
2,259,"  We investigate degenerate saddle point problems, which can be viewed as limit
cases of standard mixed formulations of symmetric problems with large jumps in
coefficients. We prove that they are well-posed in a standard norm despite the
degeneracy. By wellposedness we mean a stable dependence of the solution on the
right-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into
separate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is
used. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or
inf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze
how they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We
suggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case. The
LBB or inf--sup condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness of the
problem with respect to the Lagrange multiplier under some assumptions. The
generalized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness
of the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other
assumptions. We connect the generalized coercivity condition to the
positiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several
equivalent expressions for the minimum gap. Our results provide a foundation
for research on uniform wellposedness of mixed formulations of symmetric
problems with large jumps in coefficients in a standard norm, independent of
the jumps. Such problems appear, e.g., in numerical simulations of composite
materials made of components with contrasting properties.
"
2,260,"  This paper is concerned with optimum diversity receiver structure and its
performance analysis of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) with
differential detection over nonselective, independent, nonidentically
distributed, Rayleigh fading channels. The fading process in each branch is
assumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler bandwidth,
but to have distinct, asymmetric fading power spectral density characteristic.
Using 8-DPSK as an example, the average bit error probability (BEP) of the
optimum diversity receiver is obtained by calculating the BEP for each of the
three individual bits. The BEP results derived are given in exact, explicit,
closed-form expressions which show clearly the behavior of the performance as a
function of various system parameters.
"
2,261,"  We consider testing independence in group-wise selections with some
restrictions on combinations of choices. We present models for frequency data
of selections for which it is easy to perform conditional tests by Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. When the restrictions on the combinations can be
described in terms of a Segre-Veronese configuration, an explicit form of a
Gr\""obner basis consisting of moves of degree two is readily available for
performing a Markov chain. We illustrate our setting with the National Center
Test for university entrance examinations in Japan. We also apply our method to
testing independence hypotheses involving genotypes at more than one locus or
haplotypes of alleles on the same chromosome.
"
2,262,"  We introduce a new type of local and microlocal asymptotic analysis in
algebras of generalized functions, based on the presheaf properties of those
algebras and on the properties of their elements with respect to a regularizing
parameter. Contrary to the more classical frequential analysis based on the
Fourier transform, we can describe a singular asymptotic spectrum which has
good properties with respect to nonlinear operations. In this spirit we give
several examples of propagation of singularities through nonlinear operators.
"
2,263,"  Main change from v1 : theorem C has been modified, see remark 3.1.7 (2).
  We study the category of B-pairs (W_e,W_dR^+) where W_e is a free
B_cris^{phi=1}-module with a semilinear and continuous action of G_K and where
W_dR^+ is a G_K-stable B_dR^+ -lattice in B_dR \otimes W_e. This category
contains the category of p-adic representations and is naturally equivalent to
the category of all (phi,Gamma)-modules over the Robba ring.
"
2,264,"  Addition theorems are principal tools that express a function $f (\bm{r} \pm
\bm{r}')$ in terms of products of other functions that only depend on either
$\bm{r}$ or $\bm{r}'$. The best known example of such an addition theorem is
the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic
two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\bf 309}, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived
one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\beta \to
0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential
$\exp \bigl(-\beta | \bm{r}-\bm{r}'| \bigr) /| \bm{r}-\bm{r}'|$. At first
sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point
of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases
fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of
functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but
Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal
Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a
dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the
one-center limit $\bm{r}' = \bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition
theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.
Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces
implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the
Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition
theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the
sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.
"
2,265,"  The interrelation between the cyclic structure of an ideal, i.e., a cyclic
code over Galois field $GF(q)$, $q>2$, and its classes of proportional elements
is considered. This relation is used in order to define the code's weight
structure. The equidistance conditions of irreducible nonprimitive codes over
GF(q) are given. Besides that, the minimum distance for some class of
nonprimitive cyclic codes is found.
"
2,266,"  Let $V$ be a complex linear space, $G\subset\GL(V)$ be a compact group. We
consider the problem of description of polynomial hulls $\wh{Gv}$ for orbits
$Gv$, $v\in V$, assuming that the identity component of $G$ is a torus $T$. The
paper contains a universal construction for orbits which satisfy the inclusion
$Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ and a characterization of pairs $(G,V)$ such that it is
true for a generic $v\in V$. The hull of a finite union of $T$-orbits in
$T^\bbC v$ can be distinguished in $\clos T^\bbC v$ by a finite collection of
inequalities of the type $\abs{z_1}^{s_1}...\abs{z_n}^{s_n}\leq c$. In
particular, this is true for $Gv$. If powers in the monomials are independent
of $v$, $Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ for a generic $v$, and either the center of $G$ is
finite or $T^\bbC$ has an open orbit, then the space $V$ and the group $G$ are
products of standard ones; the latter means that $G=S_nT$, where $S_n$ is the
group of all permutations of coordinates and $T$ is either $\bbT^n$ or
$\SU(n)\cap\bbT^n$, where $\bbT^n$ is the torus of all diagonal matrices in
$\rU(n)$. The paper also contains a description of polynomial hulls for orbits
of isotropy groups of bounded symmetric domains. This result is already known,
but we formulate it in a different form and supply with a shorter proof.
"
2,267,"  Although powers of the Young-Jucys-Murphya elements X_i = (1 i) + ... +(i-1
i), i = 1, ..., n, in the symmetric group S_n acting on {1, ...,n} do not lie
in the centre of the group algebra of S_n, we show that transitive powers,
namely the sum of the contributions from elements that act transitively on {1,
>...,n}, are central. We determine the coefficients, which we call star
factorization numbers, that occur in the resolution of transitive powers with
respect to the class basis of the centre of S_n, and show that they have a
polynomiality property. These centrality and polynomiality properties have
seemingly unrelated consequences. First, they answer a question raised by Pak
about reduced decompositions; second, they explain and extend the beautiful
symmetry result discovered by Irving and Rattan; and thirdly, we relate the
polynomiality to an existing polynomiality result for a class of double Hurwitz
numbers associated with branched covers of the sphere, which therefore suggests
that there may be an ELSV-type formula associated with the star factorization
numbers.
"
2,268,"  Using a noncommutative analog of Chevalley's decomposition of polynomials
into symmetric polynomials times coinvariants due to Bergeron, Reutenauer,
Rosas, and Zabrocki we compute the graded Frobenius series for their two sets
of noncommutative harmonics with respect to the left action of the symmetric
group (acting on variables). We use these results to derive the Frobenius
series for the enveloping algebra of the derived free Lie algebra in n
variables.
"
2,269,"  We consider operators $H_\mu$ of convolution with measures $\mu$ on locally
compact groups. We characterize the spectrum of $H_\mu$ by constructing
auxiliary operators whose kernel contain the pure point and singular subspaces
of $H_\mu$, respectively. The proofs rely on commutator methods.
"
2,270,"  A quadrilateral of factors is an irreducible inclusion of factors $N \subset
M$ with intermediate subfactors $P$ and $Q$ such that $P$ and $Q$ generate $M$
and the intersection of $P$ and $Q$ is $N$. We investigate the structure of a
non-commuting quadrilateral of factors with all the elementary inclusions
$P\subset M$, $Q\subset M$, $N\subset P$, and $N\subset Q$ 2-supertransitive.
In particular we classify such quadrilaterals with the indices of the
elementary subfactors less than or equal to 4. We also compute the angles
between $P$ and $Q$ for quadrilaterals coming from $\alpha$-induction and
asymptotic inclusions.
"
2,271,"  To any complex Hadamard matrix H one associates a spin model commuting
square, and therefore a hyperfinite subfactor. The standard invariant of this
subfactor captures certain ""group-like"" symmetries of H. To gain some insight,
we compute the first few relative commutants of such subfactors for Hadamard
matrices of small dimensions. Also, we show that subfactors arising from Dita
type matrices have intermediate subfactors, and thus their standard invariants
have some extra structure besides the Jones projections.
"
2,272,"  This paper explores the following question: what kind of statistical
guarantees can be given when doing variable selection in high-dimensional
models? In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage
regression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the
second stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use
hypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two
stages as ""screening"" and the last stage as ""cleaning."" We consider three
screening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise
regression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain
conditions.
"
2,273,"  We use $p$-component fermions $(p=2,3,...)$ to present $(2p-2)N$-fold
integrals as a fermionic expectation value. This yields fermionic
representation for various $(2p-2)$-matrix models. Links with the $p$-component
KP hierarchy and also with the $p$-component TL hierarchy are discussed. We
show that the set of all (but two) flows of $p$-component TL changes standard
matrix models to new ones.
"
2,274,"  We use the fermionic construction of two-matrix model partition functions to
evaluate integrals over rational symmetric functions. This approach is
complementary to the one used in the paper ``Integrals of Rational Symmetric
Functions, Two-Matrix Models and Biorthogonal Polynomials'' \cite{paper2},
where these integrals were evaluated by a direct method.
"
2,275,"  Tau functions expressed as fermionic expectation values are shown to provide
a natural and straightforward description of a number of random processes and
statistical models involving hard core configurations of identical particles on
the integer lattice, like a discrete version simple exclusion processes (ASEP),
nonintersecting random walkers, lattice Coulomb gas models and others, as well
as providing a powerful tool for combinatorial calculations involving paths
between pairs of partitions. We study the decay of the initial step function
within the discrete ASEP (d-ASEP) model as an example.
"
2,276,"  We study KPP pulsating front speed-up and effective diffusivity enhancement
by general periodic incompressible flows. We prove the existence of and
determine the limits $c^*(A)/A$ and $D(A)/A^2$ as $A\to\infty$, where $c^*(A)$
is the minimal front speed and $D(A)$ the effective diffusivity.
"
2,277,"  We consider reaction-diffusion equations with combustion-type non-linearities
in two dimensions and study speed-up of their pulsating fronts by general
periodic incompressible flows with a cellular structure. We show that the
occurence of front speed-up in the sense $\lim_{A\to\infty} c_*(A)=\infty$,
with $A$ the amplitude of the flow and $c_*(A)$ the (minimal) front speed, only
depends on the geometry of the flow and not on the reaction function. In
particular, front speed-up happens for KPP reactions if and only if it does for
ignition reactions. We also show that the flows which achieve this speed-up are
precisely those which, when scaled properly, are able to quench any ignition
reaction.
"
2,278,"  Any homogeneous polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ of degree $d$, being restricted to a
unit sphere $S^2$, admits essentially a unique representation of the form
$\lambda + \sum_{k = 1}^d [\prod_{j = 1}^k L_{kj}]$, where $L_{kj}$'s are
linear forms in $x, y$ and $z$ and $\lambda$ is a real number. The coefficients
of these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are called \emph{multipole}
vectors of $P$. In this paper we consider similar multipole representations of
polynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$,
real and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is not
unique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate the
combinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with some
classical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositions
of functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classical
theorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator
$\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general differential operators $\Delta_Q$ that are
constructed with the help of the quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introduce
modular spaces of multipoles. We study their intricate geometry and topology
using methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The multipole
spaces are ramified over vector or projective spaces, and the compliments to
the ramification sets give rise to a rich family of $K(\pi, 1)$-spaces, where
$\pi$ runs over a variety of modified braid groups.
"
2,279,"  We define an integral Borel-Moore homology theory over finite fields, called
arithmetic homology, and an integral version of Kato homology. Both types of
groups are expected to be finitely generated, and sit in a long exact sequence
with higher Chow groups of zero-cycles.
"
2,280,"  Harvey and Lawson introduced the Kaehler rank and computed it in connection
to the cone of positive exact currents of bidimension (1,1) for many classes of
compact complex surfaces. In this paper we extend these computations to the
only further known class of surfaces not considered by them, that of Kato
surfaces. Our main tool is the reduction to the dynamics of associated
holomorphic contractions.
"
2,281,"  We prove dispersive estimates for the low frequency part of the Schrodinger
group for a large class of potentials in dimensions greater or equal to four.
As a consequence, we extend the result of Journe, Sofer and Sogge to a larger
class of potentials. In this revised version a mistake in the proof of the
estimate (B.4) is removed.
"
2,282,"  The large time behavior of solutions to Cauchy problem for viscous
Hamilton-Jacobi equation is classified. The large time asymptotics are given by
very singular self-similar solutions on one hand and by self-similar viscosity
solutions on the other hand
"
2,283,"  The large time behavior of zero mass solutions to the Cauchy problem for a
convection-diffusion equation. We provide conditions on the size and shape of
the initial datum such that the large time asymptotics of solutions is given
either by the derivative of the Guass-Weierstrass kernel or by a self-similar
solution or by a hyperbolic N-wave
"
2,284,"  These lecture notes describe the current state of affairs for Manin's
conjecture in the context of del Pezzo surfaces.
"
2,285,"  We consider a tippe top modeled as an eccentric sphere, spinning on a
horizontal table and subject to a sliding friction. Ignoring translational
effects, we show that the system is reducible using a Routhian reduction
technique. The reduced system is a two dimensional system of second order
differential equations, that allows an elegant and compact way to retrieve the
classification of tippe tops in six groups as proposed in [1] according to the
existence and stability type of the steady states.
"
2,286,"  In this paper we study one dimensional backward stochastic differential
equations (BSDEs) with random terminal time not necessarily bounded or finite
when the generator F(t,Y,Z) has a quadratic growth in Z. We provide existence
and uniqueness of a bounded solution of such BSDEs and, in the case of infinite
horizon, regular dependence on parameters. The obtained results are then
applied to prove existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to elliptic
partial differential equations in Hilbert spaces.
"
2,287,"  In this work we study some general classes of pseudodifferential operators
whose symbols are defined in terms of phase space estimates.
"
2,288,"  Interpreting entwining structures as special instances of J. Beck's
distributive law, the concept of entwining module can be generalized for the
setting of arbitrary monoidal category. In this paper, we use the distributive
law formalism to extend in this setting basic properties of entwining modules.
"
2,289,"  Given a projective variety X over an algebraically closed field of
characteristic zero, we show that finite parabolic bundles along a fixed simple
normal crossings divisor D are in one to one correspondence with
representations of the \'etale fundamental group of X-D.
"
2,290,"  Starting from certain perverse sheaves on an abelian variety, including the
intersection cohomology sheaves of curves and smooth ample divisors, we
construct a semisimple super-Tannakian category.
"
2,291,"  We define an invariant of welded virtual knots from each finite crossed
module by considering crossed module invariants of ribbon knotted surfaces
which are naturally associated with them. We elucidate that the invariants
obtained are non trivial by calculating explicit examples. We define welded
virtual graphs and consider invariants of them defined in a similar way.
"
2,292,"  In this article we study Cohen-Macaulay modules over one-dimensional
hypersurface singularities and the relationship with the representation theory
of associative algebras using methods of cluster tilting theory. We give a
criterion for existence of cluster tilting objects and their complete
description by homological methods, using higher almost split sequences and
results from birational geometry. We obtain a large class of 2-CY tilted
algebras which are finite dimensional symmetric and satisfy $\tau^2=\id$. In
particular, we compute 2-CY tilted algebras for simple and minimally elliptic
curve singularities.
"
2,293,"  We prove a double-exponential upper bound on the degree and on the complexity
of constructing a Janet basis of a $D$-module. This generalizes a well known
bound on the complexity of a Gr\""obner basis of a module over the algebra of
polynomials. We would like to emphasize that the obtained bound can not be
immediately deduced from the commutative case.
"
2,294,"  We prove the existence of the intersection local time for two independent, d
-dimensional fractional Brownian motions with the same Hurst parameter H.
Assume d greater or equal to 2, then the intersection local time exists if and
only if Hd<2.
"
2,295,"  Sharkovskii proved that the existence of a periodic orbit in a
one-dimensional dynamical system implies existence of infinitely many periodic
orbits. We obtain an analog of Sharkovskii's theorem for periodic orbits of
shear homeomorphisms of the torus. This is done by obtaining a dynamical order
relation on the set of simple orbits and simple pairs. We then use this order
relation for a global analysis for a quantum chaotic physical system called the
kicked accelerated particle.
"
2,296,"  If the $\ell$-adic cohomology of a projective smooth variety, defined over a
$\frak{p}$-adic field $K$ with finite residue field $k$, is supported in
codimension $\ge 1$, then any model over the ring of integers of $K$ has a
$k$-rational point. This slightly improves our earlier result math/0405318: we
needed there the model to be regular (but then our result was more general: we
obtained a congruence for the number of points, and $K$ could be local of
characteristic $p>0$).
"
2,297,"  We give a simple geometric proof that $e$ is irrational, using a construction
of a nested sequence of closed intervals with intersection $e$. The proof leads
to a new measure of irrationality for $e$: if $p$ and $q$ are integers with $q
> 1$, then $|e - p/q| > 1/(S(q)+1)!$, where $S(q)$ is the smallest positive
integer such that $S(q)!$ is a multiple of $q$. We relate this measure for $e$
to a known one and to the greatest prime factor of an integer. We make two
conjectures and recall a theorem of Cantor that can be proved by a similar
construction.
"
2,298,"  Food scientists at the U.S. Army's Natick Solider Center have developed a
model for the lifecyle of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in intermediate
moisture bread. In this article, we study this model using dynamical systems
and Lie symmetry methods. We calculate center manifolds and Lie symmetries for
different cases of parameter values and compare our results to those of the
food scientists.
"
2,299,"  We consider a problem of nuclear waste contamination. It takes into account
the thermal effects. The temperature and the contaminant's concentration
fulfill convection-diffusion-reaction equations. The velocity and the pressure
in the flow satisfy the Darcy equation, with a viscosity depending on both
concentration and temperature. The equations are nonlinear and strongly
coupled. Using both finite volume and nonconforming finite element methods, we
introduce a scheme adapted to this problem. We prove the stability and
convergence of this scheme and give some error estimates.
"
2,300,"  A non-Hermitian complex symmetric 2x2 matrix toy model is used to study
projective Hilbert space structures in the vicinity of exceptional points
(EPs). The bi-orthogonal eigenvectors of a diagonalizable matrix are
Puiseux-expanded in terms of the root vectors at the EP. It is shown that the
apparent contradiction between the two incompatible normalization conditions
with finite and singular behavior in the EP-limit can be resolved by
projectively extending the original Hilbert space. The complementary
normalization conditions correspond then to two different affine charts of this
enlarged projective Hilbert space. Geometric phase and phase jump behavior are
analyzed and the usefulness of the phase rigidity as measure for the distance
to EP configurations is demonstrated. Finally, EP-related aspects of
PT-symmetrically extended Quantum Mechanics are discussed and a conjecture
concerning the quantum brachistochrone problem is formulated.
